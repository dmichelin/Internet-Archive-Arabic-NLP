Includes terrific views of early types of jet engines and components including compressors, fans, combustion chambers, and so on. At the 13 minute mark a variety of other uses for the turbine engine are shown including for power generation, fire fighting, marine propulsion, gas turbine locomotives, and more. A prototype gas turbine car known as the Firebird is also shown at the 13COLON30 mark, probably at the Motorama, and at 15COLON40. </div><div><br /></div><div>The General Motors Firebird is a quartet of prototype cars designed by Harley Earl, and engineered by General Motors for the 1953, 1956 and 1959 Motorama auto shows. They were very much inspired by innovations in fighter aircraft design at the time. None of the designs were intended for production, but instead were to showcase the extremes in technology and design that General Motors was able to achieve. The cars were recently placed on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and still make regular car show appearances.</div><div><br /></div><div>The name "Firebird" was also used by the Pontiac division of General Motors for the line of pony cars, which has no direct relation to the concept cars.</div><div><br /></div><div>The film includes footage of the prototype Boeing 707 aircraft in flight at the 15COLON30 mark.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Wood River, Illinois facility of Shell Oil is also shown at the 15 minute mark, where jet fuels were exhaustively studied. </div><div><br /></div><div>A gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of internal combustion engine. It has an upstream rotating compressor coupled to a downstream turbine, and a combustion chamber in between.</div><div><br /></div><div>The basic operation of the gas turbine is similar to that of the steam power plant except that air is used instead of water. Fresh atmospheric air flows through a compressor that brings it to higher pressure. Energy is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. This high-temperature high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The turbine shaft work is used to drive the compressor and other devices such as an electric generator that may be coupled to the shaft. The energy that is not used for shaft work comes out in the exhaust gases, so these have either a high temperature or a high velocity. The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable energy form is maximized. Gas turbines are used to power aircraft, trains, ships, electrical generators, or even tanks.</div><div><br /></div><div>Airbreathing jet engines are gas turbines optimized to produce thrust from the exhaust gases, or from ducted fans connected to the gas turbines. Jet engines that produce thrust from the direct impulse of exhaust gases are often called turbojets, whereas |addeddate 2015-07-20 20COLON41COLON48 |title The Gas Turbine Engine Jet Engine Shell Oil Company Film 74782 |uploader contact periscopefilm.com

The Taliban's Education Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi told the Afghan Islamic Press news agency that seven US raids severely damaged the Kajaki dam and hydroelectric plant, completely knocking out the power supplies of the Southern city of Kandahar. The damn holds back 2.7 billion cubic meters of water. It normally produces 150,000 kilowatts of electricity per hour and irrigates land farmed by 75,000 families in a desert area where water is a precious commodity. Jeremy Scahill has more. ANTHRAX REACHES MIDDLE AMERICA 3COLON21 Anthrax reached middle America today. Preliminary tests found anthrax spores in a Kansas City, Mo., postal facility, and about 200 workers were told to join tens of thousands others from elsewhere who are taking antibiotics to ward off possible infection. Anthrax was also found at a private postal maintenance center in Indianapolis on equipment sent from a contaminated mail-processing center in Trenton. New Jersey.Those workers are also taking anti-biotics. But as Geoff Brady reports from New York, postal workers exposed to anthrax spores aren't being tested to see if they've contracted the disease. ASHCROFT DETAINS 1,000+, 3COLON29 Attorney General John Ashcroft announced for the first time today that the government had apprehended suspects which he said had advance knowledge of the September 11th hijackings. ... Ashcroft said three Arab men who lived in Michigan had been found in possession of airport diagrams, as well as false immigration forms, and a fraudulent American visa and a false alien identification card. Ashcroft cited the detention of the three men as proof of the value of a nationwide effort by federal law enforcement agencies to round up immigrants with ties to terrorists. Ashcroft's announcement comes days after a coalition of civil rights and civil liberties groups filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking the identification of and charges against the more than 1,000 mostly Arab and Muslim Americans who have been detained in Ashcroft's post-September 11th dragnet. But as Kata Mester reports from Washington, their identities remain secret.

About 3.5 tons of pharmaceuticals were turned by the public during Medicine Collection Day on Saturday, April 19, 2008 organized by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD). The Milwaukee Department of Public Works (DPW) organized an electronics collection on Saturday, April 26, 2008 that garner about 32 tons of electronics. The site off-loaded an average of three cars per minute. The electronics are called e-waste. About 700 cars dropped off electronics during the event organized by the City of Milwaukee DPW was held on April 26, 2008 More than two thirds of the collection involved computers and related equipment. The DPW collected 643 computer monitors weighing over ten tons; 338 televisions weighing over 5 tons, over 7 tons of personal computers and nearly 5 tons of computer printers. Eight percent of the collection, nearly 5,000 pounds, involved miscellaneous e-waste like cell phones. ------- Equipment type Pounds Percent by Weight Monitors 21,188 33% (643 computer monitors recycled) PCs 15,098 24% TVs 13,185 21% (338 televisions recycled) Printers 9,148 14% Miscellaneous 4,878 8% TOTAL 63,497 100% ------- The challenge was important because scrap electronics are the fastest growing segment of municipal solid waste stream. E-waste may contain hazardous materials including lead, mercury and heavy metals that can pose a risk to human and environmental health. The EPA awarded $500,000 in grants to numerous cities participating in the challenge including the city of Milwaukee. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said the "recycling televisions and computers reduces the risks of toxins contained in these products being released into our air and water." Event partners included the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, city of Milwaukee Department of Public Works (DPW), Keep Greater Milwaukee Beautiful, the Italian Community Center, Midwest Computer Recyclers and WISN-TV. About 3.5 tons of pharmaceuticals were turned during the Milwaukee area's Medicine Collection Day sponsored by the MMSD. The collection name was a "prescription for clean water and safe kids." ------- Non-Controlled Controlled Participants Substances Substances Milwaukee County 1,080 4,487 lbs 36,831 (Pills, Patches & Bottles) Ozaukee County 365 1,022 lbs 3 (30 gallon drums) Racine County 523 761 lbs 50 lbs Washington County 380 743 lbs 83 lbs TotalsCOLON 2,348 7,013 lbs ------- Veolia Environmental Services incinerates non-controlled substances at a federally licensed facility.

The meeting was held in an auditorium and included everyone – from agents to the secretaries. The meeting was organized by the Director of the Biometric Identification Management Agency (BIMA), Colonel Bolo (ret.).<br /><br /> Bolo summarized the purchase of 24 new armored vehicles (each costing $400k) and the recent appearance of 20 mobile headquarters that are now present at the facility. The mobile units are semi-trailers with attached generators in the front; are of a shiny, mirrored-silver finish; and have no identifiable markings on them at all. There are 20 of them parked (visibly in front) at 1000 Cluster Hollow Rd, Clarksburg, WV as of today. Additionally, there are 24 armored cars (the same ones we have seen with DHS markings) parked in a different lot on this property, but they too may be visible.<br /><br /> The Colonel went into great detail on a list of patriot/constitutional groups. According to witnesses, this is a list that may be identical or very close to the one put out by the SPLC but had over 1000 groups on it. He explained that although groups may take advantage of the 2nd Amendment debate to garner followers now, at the heart of all these organizations is a racist core; one that poses a threat and will need to be dealt with soon. This is when he tied the armored cars and mobile command trailers to ‘the mission’.<br /><br /> The armored cars (those at the facility and nationwide) are to effect high-risk warrants on the ringleaders of the listed various groups with command centers being placed as necessary. The DHS and FBI are planning to move at one time against the listed groups; with SWAT teams being utilized |uploader archive seattlecommunitymedia.org |subject Newsmagazine |date 2013-03-18 |collection SeattleCommunityMedia community_media newsandpublicaffairs |publicdate 2016-01-22 00COLON37COLON59 |addeddate 2016-01-22 00COLON37COLON59 |creator Patricia Shupe hostess, co-producer - scantv77 gmail.com 479-471-1895 |title C4I for March 19, Stew's news hits the fan. |runtime 00COLON58COLON19

The SRL payload, which first flew during STS-59 in April 1994, will again give scientists highly detailed information that will help them distinguish between human-induced environmental changes and other natural forms of change. SRL-2 will take radar images of the Earth's surface for Earth system sciences studies, including geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy and botany. The SRL payload is comprised of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS). The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument. The imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments has the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, also can "see" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface. The SIR-C/X-SAR radar data provide information about how many of Earth's complex systems - those processes that control the movement of land, water, air and life - work together to make this a livable planet. The science team particularly wants to study the amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands areas, geologic features such as rock types and their distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind speed. STS-68 will fly over the same sites that STS-59 observed so that scientists will be able to study seasonal changes that may have occurred in those areas between the missions. An international team of 49 science investigators and three associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments. Thirteen nations are representedCOLON Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United States. The MAPS experiment will measure the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the troposphere, or lower atmosphere. Measurements of carbon monoxide, an important element in several chemical cycles, provide scientists with indications of how well the atmosphere can cleanse itself of "greenhouse gases," chemicals that can increase the atmosphere's temperature.
