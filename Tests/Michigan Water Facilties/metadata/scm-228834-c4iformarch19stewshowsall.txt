The meeting was held in an auditorium and included everyone \u2013 from agents to the secretaries. The meeting was organized by the Director of the Biometric Identification Management Agency (BIMA), Colonel Bolo (ret.).<br /><br />  Bolo summarized the purchase of 24 new armored vehicles (each costing $400k) and the recent appearance of 20 mobile headquarters that are now present at the facility.  The mobile units are semi-trailers with attached generators in the front; are of a shiny, mirrored-silver finish; and have no identifiable markings on them at all. There are 20 of them parked (visibly in front) at 1000 Cluster Hollow Rd, Clarksburg, WV as of today. Additionally, there are 24 armored cars (the same ones we have seen with DHS markings) parked in a different lot on this property, but they too may be visible.<br /><br />  The Colonel went into great detail on a list of patriot/constitutional groups. According to witnesses, this is a list that may be identical or very close to the one put out by the SPLC but had over 1000 groups on it. He explained that although groups may take advantage of the 2nd Amendment debate to garner followers now, at the heart of all these organizations is a racist core; one that poses a threat and will need to be dealt with soon. This is when he tied the armored cars and mobile command trailers to \u2018the mission\u2019.<br /><br />  The armored cars (those at the facility and nationwide) are to effect high-risk warrants on the ringleaders of the listed various groups with command centers being placed as necessary. The DHS and FBI are planning to move at one time against the listed groups; with SWAT teams being utilized against the more threatening ones. The colonel explained that all these groups have been successfully infiltrated and the leaders identified. He also explained that this is part of the new Internal Security Force that the president has been alluding to. In answering a question from an attendee regarding the mass purchase of ammo, he also stated that the buildup of arms and ammo was specifically for this \u2018mission\u2019.<br /><br />  The witness has told me that after the meeting, everyone they seen were against this. People were complaining, shaking their head in disbelief, and asking what the heck going on. According to them, NOBODY (including federal agents present) planned on going along with this and many even talked about how this will ignite a war.<br /><br />  The report I received can be verified through any personal contacts you may have at this center or connected to the agencies mentioned. You may also visibly inspect the lot for these trailers by driving to the location in Clarksburg. The witness was extremely bothered by the meeting and has said \u2018it is coming and a hell of a lot sooner than people think\u2019.<br /><br />  I used to think that mass roundups would never happen \u2013 but with this new information, I can clearly see that this is exactly what is going to happen (at least to a certain number of militia/patriot groups). And inevitably, any action this crazy will result in a reaction by others. The specter of Civil War in this country is a real and present danger folks \u2013 prepare.<br /><br />  NOTE: I did ask a whole bunch of additional questions which hopefully will be answered soon.<br /><br />  *Thanks given to the Indiana Sentinels and the Frontiersmen for the information*<br /><br /><br />  28 States Now To Feds - Hands Off Our Guns<br /><br /><br /><br />  http://investmentwatchblog.com/they-are-about-to-take-your-savings-bank-holiday-america-you-are-next/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 VIDEO<br /><br />  http://beforeitsnews.com/beyond-science/2013/03/giant-crystal-pyramid-discovered-in-bermuda-triangle-2441348.html<br />  Giant Crystal Pyramid Discovered In Bermuda Triangle<br />  Telecoms firm hails 'significant victory' as judge blocks FBI's data demands<br /><br />  FBI's demands for private data struck down by federal co urt<br /><br />  Brooklyn under siege Day 4 as of the day of this recording of the news<br /><br />  MI6 and CIA were told before invasion that Iraq had no active WMD<br /><br /><br />  Peter Schiff: Insured Bank Deposits At Risk, America Burns While Obama Golfs<br /><br />  Banking Chief Calls For 15% Looting of Italians\u2019 Savings<br /><br />  The Collapse is Starting!

The globalists through their government minions are in the process of destroying massive bodies of water including, but not limited to Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The destruction is not because of neglect, it is willful destruction with very ulterior motives in mind.<br />  2. The globalists are using nitrates from fertilizer and Corexit to accomplish their desire to create a dead zone in the aforementioned bodies of water.<br />  3. The globalists are creating water dead zones which will allow the proliferation of algae growth and the oil companies have initially led the charge to convert our energy usage from oil to algae.<br />  4. Prominent globalists are involved in this conspiracy and have contributed massive resources to this endeavor.<br />  5. Prominent globalists are attempting to buy up as much water as possible to exacerbate the destruction of water resources in the aforementioned areas. In other words, Americans are looking at extreme water scarcity from which the globalists can wage wars and force submission to their will while at the same time carry out their stated depopulation agenda.<br />  6. My instincts tell me that this conspiracy has more breadth and depth than what is revealed here and it is my sincere hope that my fellow researchers will afford some much needed attention to these issues because I strongly believe there is more to learn and we do not have much time because humanity\u2019s fate hangs in the balance. <br />  How many times in the history of the insurance industry, have individuals or businesses been caught setting fire to their homes and businesses in order to receive a lucrative payout of insurance money? This is exactly what BP and Exxon are doing. They are intentionally burning down their own home (oil) in order to construct a behemoth palace (bio-fuels). From Parts Five and Six of this series, it was conclusively proven that BP, Goldman Sachs, Transocean and Halliburton prepositioned (e.g. BP stock dumping) themselves to make money from the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. However, there is a lot more going on in the Gulf than a handful of corporations each making hundreds of millions of dollars from their contrived role in the oil spill. The motive to destroy the Gulf holds the promise of making certain entities and individuals multi-trillions of dollars. <br />  The Obama administration and many others (individual billionaires, select politicians, BP, Exxon, Nalco, GM, GE, Goldman Sachs, University of Chicago, and many others including the Department of Defense are all deeply invested in bio-fuels. These billionaire psychopaths will willingly sacrifice the Gulf and all of its residents for this multi Trillion Dollar industry representing a new era of energy applications.<br />  Algae Will Replace Oil As the Nation\u2019s Energy Source<br />  Nitrogen fertilizers and Corexit are being used to systematically create dead zones in large bodies of water in the United States. The use of nitrogen fertilizers and Corexit are accomplishing the same result. This is no coincidence as the tragedy in the Gulf was perpetrated to accomplish this end.<br />  Farmers apply nitrogen fertilizer to crops to increase yield. Farmers are compensated by the government for crop yield. Therefore, farmers overload the soil and plants absorb 30 to 50% of the nitrogen, and as much as 70%, or 87 pounds per acre will end up running off into the nearest body of water. The only thing that grows in this environment is algae. Therefore, nitrogen has a decided evil side as it is creating huge problems with major bodies of water that we are only now beginning to understand. The EPA is aware of the problem, yet remains silent on the issue.<br />  Chesapeake Bay is polluted beyond repair in which massive fish kills, general habitat degradation\u00a0 and bacteria proliferations threatens the health of humans and the damage is rampant. This massive pollution, resulting from the nitrogen runoffs resulting from agricultural endeavors, fills the Chesapeake Bay and, again, the only substance which flourishes in the bay is algae.<br />  Each and every spring, excess fertilizer is deposited into from the Mississippi River which eventually ends up in the Gulf of Mexico, thus causing a massive algae bloom that leads to a giant oxygen-deprived \u201cdead zone\u201d where fish can\u2019t survive. And the same thing is going on in the Great Lakes in places like Lake Erie.<br />  Following the Gulf oil spill, and against all common sense, the most lethal form of dispersant, Corexit, was used to treat the oil spill. Instead, what happened is that the spill has resulted in the creation of the second largest dead zone body of water in the world, second only to the Baltic Ocean. And as the reader will discover, later in this article, the new energy craze among the so-called environmentalists is algae. In isolation, we seem to only be looking at a pollution problem that the EPA should deal with. Simply put, the use of nitrogen fertilizer and Corexit should be banned. However, when we look at the totality of the Corexit/nitrogen problem being used to destroy our water supplies, one should immediately sit up and take notice.<br />  Once, one understands that Algae proliferates in an otherwise dead zone of water, then one will understand why Corexit was used in the Gulf. And when one understands that fact, one can only conclude that Gulf oil spill was not an accident as it marks the ushering in of a new era in which the bio-fuel, algae, will replace oil and amazingly, the oil companies are among those who are behind this plot to destroy major bodies of water in order to allow for the propagation of algae.<br />  President Obama is also participating in this conspiracy against humanity. On March 15, 2013, President Obama announced that it is his intention to move American vehicles away from oil to bio-fuels. Obama, amazingly in this period of Sequestration, has asked Congress for two billion dollars to expand research in this area. And isn\u2019t it and interesting coincidence that the President\u2019s science advisor, John Holdren, in 2009, advocated for \u201cfertilizing\u201d the oceans? I remember that most people thought Holdren had lost his mind when he proposed this as a solution for global warming. However, in the context of creating dead zones through the use of Corexit and nitrogen fertilizers, his suggestion makes a great deal of sense in light of today\u2019s heightened interest in bio-fuels. This cannot be described as anything but psychopathic thinking in that the EPA would allow nitrogen fertilizers destroy major bodies of water in which only algae can grow and that this administration would even entertain the idea of creating oceanic dead zones through fertilizing these bodies of water is nothing but pure insanity. It is dangerous to the entire well-being of the planet. But of course, we are dealing with psychopaths.<br />  How many brush fires equals an all out forest fire? How many coincidences does it take to make a conspiracy? For those that think that there are some interesting thoughts presented here, but the conspiracy angle of destroying major bodies of water to foster the growth of algae needs more proof, let\u2019s take a look at a variable which will connect all the dots.<br />  Amazingly, the oil companies are attempting to lead the way in the process of converting our energy sources from oil to bio-fuels such as algae. Burning Down Their Own Houses<br />  As I began to realize that many of our major bodies of water were being destroyed and all that was necessary to reverse the destruction was to halt the use of nitrogen fertilizers. Then I discovered that Corexit creates the same kind of dead zones just like nitrogen which also was unnecessary in its use because a less virulent dispersant could have been used in the Gulf. Did you know that Corexit is banned in 19 countries? It was at that moment that the light went on for me as I realized that we were witnessing the systematic destruction of major bodies of water on a grand scale coupled with my discovery that the oil companies appear to be preparing to transition from oil to algae.<br />  In August of 2009, BP entered into a partnership with Martek Biosciences to study the use of algae to convert sugar into biodiesel. Eight months later, BP\u2019s\u00a0 and Transocean\u2019s \u201cnegligence\u201d led to the oil spill which gravely impacted the food chain, poisoned all life forms in the Gulf and dealt an eventual death blow to the Gulf by creating a massive series of dead zones where nothing will grow, except for algae, for generations to come.<br />  BP is not alone with regard to a major oil company\u2019s foray into the algae business. ExxonMobil entered into a partnership with Synthetic Genomics in order to develop energy\u2019s next king, bio-fuels from algae. From this work, it was discovered that Corexit increases the bioaccumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons into golden-brown algae. For oil companies to involved in algae conversion is the metaphorical equivalent of burning down your own house in order to collect the insurance money and this is precisely what they did to the Gulf.<br />  These facts certainly beg the question as to why BP and Exxon Mobil would be investing in a technology which would threaten their only viable product, namely oil?<br />  Why Algae?<br />  Algae has the potential to avoid most of the problems of conventional bio-fuels production, such as competition with food crops, and in principle can have dramatic effects on carbon dioxide emissions, even consuming emissions from sources such as coal-fired power plants.<br />  The major problem with using algae as the next bio-fuel is that the fuel yields from algae are still too low for it to be a break even proposition. However, if that problem were to be solved, algae would be king because it is such a low maintenance substance.\u00a0 In a related and stunning development, Exxon has partnered with\u00a0 Craig Venter, the pioneer of DNA research. Venter has a stellar record of achievement in his work on the human genome. If anyone can solve the algae yield problem, Venter would the guy. However, if Venter cannot solve the problem of algae yield, OriginOil, Inc. is developing a novel technology which will transform algae into a source of renewable oil. Below is a depiction of the process.<br /><br />  It Is Not a Conspiracy Until You Follow the Money<br />  Readers need to keep in mind, that Exxon and BP began moving into the algae business several months prior to the Gulf oil spill and BP and its partners have been caught per-positioning their stock moves to maximize profits and minimize losses IN ADVANCE of the oil spill event. And now they are leading the way to convert the nation from oil to algae energy use. These twin giant oil companies have had a lot of help in making this massive conversion a reality. George Soros, is involved in \u201cclean energy conversion\u201d away from oil. Readers may recall from Part Six of this series proved that Soros financial interests were among the top five of financial institution which dumped BP stock a few short weeks before the oil spill, thus, making him a co-conspirator. And now Soros isheavily invested in Gulf algae farms as he has invested $1 billion dollars in the endeavor.<br />  The US military invested $35 million dollars in algae jet fuel. Blackstone Group consulted with the Chesapeake Bay region energy provider Constellation Energy to sell company to Warren Buffet\u00a0 and his company Berkshire Hathaway. Buffet is majorly involved in bio-fuels and the algae laden Chesapeake Bay is prime hunting ground for this globalist. Al Gore is also involved in various algae projects as well. The same cast of characters keep rearing their ugly faces in their attempt to subjugate humanity while at the same time make a King\u2019s ransom in the process. <br />  Conclusion<br />  T. Boone Pickens is well on his way to controlling over the vast Oglala Aquifer.\u00a0 Pat Stryker and Koch brothers are involved in garnering Colorado\u2019s water resources in the beta test battleground for Agenda 21. Did you know that that it is illegal, in Colorado, to reuse irrigation water and to catch rain water? We should be asking ourselves why. Additionally, the Bush family control the biggest water aquifer in South America. Meanwhile, the globalists are destroying vast amounts water resources in the United States. It seems that the globalists are hell-bent on creating water scarcity in which water<br />  I do not believe that the globalists only motive is to destroy the Gulf and fresh water supplies so that their new biofuel craze can take hold. I think this is a byproduct to what the central planners are truly after, control over all water which will result in control over who lives and dies. This and more will be covered in the next installment of the Great Gulf Coast Holocaust.<br /><br /><br /><br />  The Jesuit Oath Exposed<br />  Hold on for this one. This is an excerpt, and this oath is still in use. <br />  \"I do further promise and declare that I will, when opportunity presents, make and wage relentless war, secretly and openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Masons, as I am directed to do, to extirpate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex nor condition, and that will hang, burn, waste, boil, flay, strangle, and bury alive these infamous heretics; rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women, and crush their infants\u2019 heads against the walls in order to annihilate their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly I will secretly use the poisonous cup, the strangulation cord, the steel of the poniard, or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honour, rank, dignity or authority of the persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agents of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Father of the Society of Jesus.<br />  \"In confirmation of which I hereby dedicate my life, soul, and all corporal powers, and with the dagger which I now receive I will subscribe my name written in my blood in testimony thereof; and should I prove false, or weaken in my determination, may my brethren and fellow soldiers of the militia of the Pope cut off my hands and feet and my throat from ear to ear, my belly be opened and sulphur burned therein with all the punishment that can be inflicted upon me on earth, and my soul shall be tortured by demons in eternal hell forever....\" [Full Oath exposed HERE]<br /><br />  Revisionist History Cover Up \u2013 Meet the Jesuit Order<br />  The Jesuit Order is an almost 500-year old covert operations, geo-political, male-only organization, structured as a secret military operation: demanding secret oaths and complete obedience to each direct superior, which is ultimately the Superior General (often nicknamed as the Black Pope, since he dresses in black and \u2018stands in the shadow\u2019 of the white Pope).<br />  The \u201cSociety of Jesus\u201d \u2013 as they are officially known \u2013 was originally used by the Vatican to counter the various Reformation movements in Europe, to which the Vatican lost much of its religious and political power. Absolute-temporal-ruling power has always been the Vatican institution\u2019s primary objective. Source<br />  While so-called modern history hardly mentions how hated this fanatical sect was, it wasn\u2019t long ago that it was well known to be an \u201codious\u201d and extremely dangerous organization.<br />  Just look at these quotes:<br />  \u201cMy history of the Jesuits is not eloquently written, but it is supported by unquestionable authorities, [and] is very particular and very horrible. Their [the Jesuit Order\u2019s] restoration [in 1814 by Pope Pius VII] is indeed a step toward darkness, cruelty, despotism, [and] death. \u2026 I do not like the appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell, it is this Society of [Ignatius de] Loyola.\u201d<br />  John Adams (1735-1826; 2nd President of the United States)<br />  \u201cIt is my opinion that if the liberties of this country \u2013 the United States of America \u2013 are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.\u201d<br />  Marquis de LaFayette (1757-1834; French statesman and general. He served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.)<br />  \u201cThe war [i.e., the American Civil War of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits.\u201d<br />  Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865; 16th President of the United States)<br />  \u201cThe Jesuits\u2026are a secret society \u2013 a sort of Masonic order \u2013 with superadded features of revolting odiousness, and a thousand times more dangerous.\u201d \u2013 Samuel Morse (1791-1872; American inventor of the telegraph; author of the book Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States)<br />  \u201c[The Jesuits] are the deadly enemies of civil and religious liberty.\u201d<br />  R. W. Thompson (Ex-Secretary, American Navy)<br />  \u201cThe Jesuits are a MILITARY organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power \u2013 power in its most despotic exercise \u2013 absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man [i.e., the Black Pope, the Superior General of the Jesuits]. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms [sic] \u2013 and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses\u2026\u201d<br />  Napoleon I (i.e., Napoleon Bonaparte; 1769-1821; emperor of the French)<br />  Next, I defer to Vigilant Citizen with his succinct summary of the Illuminati/Jesuit connections:<br />  Adam Weishaupt, Trained by the Jesuits<br /><br />  Adam Weishaupt was born in Ingolstadt, Bavaria on February 6, 1748. His father died when he was seven and his godfather, Baron Ickstatt, entrusted his early education to the most powerful group of the time: the Jesuits. Known for its subversive methods and conspiratorial tendencies, the Society of Jesus had a stronghold on Bavaria\u2019s politics and educational system.<br />  \u201cThe degree of power to which the representatives of the Society of Jesus had been able to attain in Bavaria was all but absolute. Members of the order were the confessors and preceptors of the electors; hence they had a direct influence upon the policies of government. The censorship of religion had fallen into their eager hands, to the extent that some of the parishes even were compelled to recognize their authority and power. To exterminate all Protestant influence and to render the Catholic establishment complete, they had taken possession of the instruments of public education. It was by Jesuits that the majority of the Bavarian colleges were founded, and by them they were controlled. By them also the secondary schools of the country were conducted.\u201d 4<br />  The inner-workings of the Society of Jesus was quite similar to the occult Brotherhoods it was apparently working against. It functioned with degrees, initiation rites, elaborate rituals and esoteric symbols and had been suppressed countless times in several countries due to its subversive tendencies.<br />  In 1773, Weishaupt\u2019s godfather used his great influence at the University of Ingolstadt to place his godson as chair of canon law. At that time, the institution was under heavy Jesuitical dominance and that particular position was traditionally held by influential Jesuits. Weishaupt\u2019s growing embrace of Age of Enlightenment philosophies placed him at odds with the Jesuits and all kinds of political drama ensued. Despite this fact, Weishaupt learned a lot from the Jesuit\u2019s organization and their subversive methods to obtain power. It is during this time that the idea of a Secret Society began to enter Weishaupt\u2019s thoughts.<br />  \u201cBrilliant, and well trained in the conspiratorial methods of access to power, young Weishaupt decided to organize a body of conspirators, determined to free the world from the Jesuitical rule of Rome.\u201d 5<br />  While some authors believe that the Jesuits (who were suppressed by papal bull in 1773) used Weishaupt to perpetuate their rule, others state that he was seeking to overthrow their powerful hold on Bavaria. On a wider scale, he was convinced that the world would profit from the overthrow of all governmental and religious institutions in the world to replace them by a world-wide, yet secretive, committee of \u201cinitiates\u201d. To achieve his aims, he would use Jesuit methods against the Jesuits.<br />  MORE HERE<br />  The Militant Catholic Church and World Domination<br /><br />  Jesuitism stepping on the neck of Protestantism.<br />  Few would believe what the Vatican has been up to all these centuries. Vietnam was commonly known as Spelly\u2019s War, named after Cardinal Spellman. Why\u2026Exterminating infidels?<br /><br />  Cardinal Spellman gives mass to the troops in WW2<br /><br />  Successor to Fascist Dictator Francisco Franco and Knight of Malta, King Juan Carlos, with Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Andrew Cardinal Bertie<br /><br />  Knight of Malta Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1744\u20131812)<br />  The Knights of Malta is not merely a \u201ccharitable organization\u201d.<br />  That\u2019s just an elaborate front\u2026 As the name Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM) confirms, it is a military order based on the crusader Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem and is interwoven with Freemasonry. Most people have never even heard of SMOM, much less that it is a part of Freemasonry. But that is the way the aristocratic elite like it.<br /><br />  (same double eagle as Freemasonry\u2013ed.)<br />  One of the symbols of the military orders of the Vatican, the masonic double-headed eagle emblazoned with the Maltese cross, signifies omnipotent royal dominion over both East and West. The orb signifies temporal dominion over the globe of Earth, and the scepter signifies control over the spiritual and religious impulses of humanity.<br />  This eagle symbol is used in the masonic rite of Memphis and Misraim, under which it reads, \u201cOrder Out of Chaos\u201d, the Hegelian method of crisis creation. It is found on the seals of many European and Eurasian nation states including that of Russia, indicating direct Vatican control over those countries. (Source)<br />  More on the Double-headed Eagle and the \u2018Redshilds\u2019<br />  The two-headed eagle emblem of the Byzantine Empire (Roman Empire) on a Red Shield was adopted in 1743 by the infamous goldsmith Amschel Moses Bauer. He opened a coin shop in Frankfurt, Germany and hung above his door this Roman eagle on a red shield. The shop became known as the \u201cRed Shield firm\u201d. The German word for \u2018red shield\u2019 is Rothschild. After this point, the Rothschilds became the bankers to kings and pontiffs alike, among the richest families in the world. Ever since, they have financed both sides of every major war and revolution using the Hegelian Dialectic to engineer society toward their New World Order.<br />  The Rothschilds and their agents, such as the Rockefellers, have been engineering America and its foreign policy almost since its inception. They and their Skull and Bones Wall Street partners staged and funded both sides in WWII, and out of that hellish nightmare was born their infant global government, the United Nations, and their tool of tyranny, the CIA. The father of the CIA, \u201cWild Bill\u201d Donovan, was a Knight of Malta. In order to be a director of the CIA you must be a crusading Knight of Malta and it doesn\u2019t hurt if you are a member of Skull and Bones either. In order to reach the highest levels in the Pentagon establishment, you must be an illuminated Freemason and/or a Knight of one order or another. Notable US military members of SMOM include top crusading generals such as Alexander Haig, William Westmoreland, and Charles A. Willoughby, an admitted Fascist.<br />  Other notable members include:<br />  \uf0a7 Reinhard Gehlen (Nazi war criminal)<br />  \uf0a7 Heinrich Himmler (Nazi war criminal)<br />  \uf0a7 Kurt Waldheim (Nazi war criminal)<br />  \uf0a7 Franz von Papen (Hitler enabler)<br />  \uf0a7 Fritz Thyssen (Hitler\u2019s financier)<br />  \uf0a7 Rupert Murdoch<br />  \uf0a7 Tony Blair<br />  \uf0a7 Pat Buchanan<br />  \uf0a7 William F.

Then we come to another SMOM member, important to what is transpiring in Iraq and other toppled or soon to-be-toppled States. Educated at the Jesuit Georgetown University, former Pentagon Inspector General Joseph Edward Schmitz, Blackwater\u2019s operations chief, is a member of both SMOM and Opus Dei.<br /><br />  Former Pentagon Inspector General Joseph Edward Schmitz quit in 2005 to work for Blackwater. He is a member of Opus Dei and Knights of Malta. At least $2 trillion went \u201cmissing\u201d from the Pentagon during his watch.<br />  The Knights of Malta in Iraq?<br />  Malta Star | Sep 29, 2007<br />  An American investigative journalist compared the US firm Blackwater, the biggest security services provider in post war Iraq, to the Knights of Malta.<br />  The company is currently in the midst of a controversy after some of its 20,000 personnel stationed in Iraq killed a number of civilians.<br />  In his book, \u2018Blackwater: The Rise of the World\u2019s Most Powerful Mercenary Army\u2019, Jeremy Scahill links the modern security firm to the Knights of Malta.<br />  The writer argues that \u201cBlackwater\u2019s employees\u2026 share the same religious zeal of ancient crusaders\u201d, the Egyptian weekly newspaper Al-Ahram reported.<br />  All the top Nazis in our government are connected in some way to the Vatican, Jesuits and Knights of Malta and have been for decades, as were the Italian Fascists and German Nazis of WWII. After all, what was their favorite symbol after the swastika? The Maltese Cross of course!(Dejan Lucic\u2013source)<br />  Earlier Malta Boys Formed the \u201cIntelligence\u201d Agencies..<br />  Who formed the CIA? It was a Catholic Knight of Malta, William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Donovan. He was considered the \u201cfather of the CIA.\u201d he was also the former head of the OSS before he was used to create the CIA.<br /><br />  Donovan was given an especially prestigious form of knighthood that has only been given to a hundred other men in history.<br />  Over the years there have been many CIA bosses who were also Knights of Malta and/or Jesuit trained.<br />  And Who Formed the FBI?<br />  It was a powerful Roman Catholic who was also a Knight of Malta and a trustee of The Catholic University of America. Charles Joseph Bonaparte.<br /><br />  \u201cThe degree of Knight of Malta is conferred in the United States as \u201can appendant Order\u201d in a Commandery of Knights Templar. ~Source<br />  Blackwater/Xe \u2013 Today\u2019s Crusading Templars/Knights of Malta?<br />  Blackwater/Xe is more than just a \u201cprivate army\u201d, and much more than just another capitalist war-profiteering business operation.<br />  It is an army operating outside all laws, outside and above the US Constitution and yet is controlled by people within and outside our government whose allegiance is primarily to the foreign Vatican state. In other words, Blackwater/Xe is a religious army serving the Pope in Rome through the Order of Malta, which is itself considered under international law, as a sovereign entity with special diplomatic powers and privileges.<br />  Like Blackwater, the Order of Malta is \u201cuntouchable\u201d because it is at the heart of the elite aristocracy. ~Source<br />  The \u2018beauty\u2019 of private mercenaries, a growing trend worldwide as we move toward a fascist global state, is that they\u2019re not held accountable to anything like regular military bodies are, and can operate outside the confines of such things as international law, political restraints, or the immobility of large armies. In addition, when their loyalties can be traced to an over-riding allegiance to a foreign state or other seditious influence, we have even more serious problems.<br />  Erik, Prince of War<br />  Erik Prince, the founder and owner of the now infamous US corporation, Blackwater / Xe, hails from Holland, Michigan where his family was both powerful and prominent in two institutions \u2013 (1) the Republican Party and (2) the evangelical Christian Church. After scandals hit his large and lucrative firm, Prince ordered a curious rebranding that changed its name to Xe.<br />  From the perspective of medieval Christian symbology, \u2018Xe\u2019 is a combination of the Christic cross and the Greek letter, Epsilon, the first letter in the Greek word, Evangelion, glad tidings or gospel. From the perspective of a modern member of the Knights Templar, Xe is immediately recognizable as it symbolizes Christian Evangelism. (source)<br />  Prince\u2019s background<br /><br />  Now there\u2019s an honest face\u2026<br />  The Catholic connection, unlike his family, which is part of the Christian Reformed Church, Erik Prince is a Catholic.\u00a0 Interestingly enough, most of the leadership at Blackwater/Xe is also Catholic, albeit a conservative wing of the church that is quite reactionary. Erik Prince is personally connected to conservative Catholic groups like Catholic Answer, Crisis magazine, and a Grand Rapids-based group, the Acton Institute.<br />  Prince\u2019s relationship to what Scahill calls the \u201cTheocon\u201d movement is not marginal. Prince himself writes about this relationship and it\u2019s importance, particularly with the mission of Blackwater. Prince says \u201cEverybody carries guns, just like the Prophet Jeremiah rebuilding the temple in Israel \u2013 a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other.\u201d<br /><br />  Erik Prince\u2019s personal Crusade<br />  Among his personnel at Xe, Prince is known to be a high-profile Islamophobe who believes his personal mission in life is to bring about the total extinction of the Muslim population of this planet in what he has described as a global campaign of genocide or a, \u201cCrusade.\u201d<br />  Here is an excerpt of an article about Prince that appeared in The Economist:<br />  In an affidavit lodged with a court in Virginia, one of the witnesses said that Mr Prince \u201cviews himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe.\u201d The statement continues\u2026<br />  \u201cTo that end, Mr. Prince intentionally deployed to Iraq certain men who shared his vision of Christian supremacy, knowing and wanting these men to take every available opportunity to murder Iraqis. Many of these men used call signs based on the Knights of the Templar, the warriors who fought the Crusades.\u201d<br />  How comforting. Murder for hire meets religious zeal embedded in Christian patriotism. Nice combo.<br /><br />  Blackwater/Xe Headquarters in Moyock, N.C.<br />  Beware: They\u2019re Proliferating\u2026<br />  It gets worse, this captivating cause, these deviant demons, are metastasizing:<br />  Through a network of 30 subsidiaries and shell corporations, Blackwater-linked entities provided \u201cintelligence, training and security services\u201d to a cache of major multinational firms, including: Monsanto, Chevron, the Walt Disney Company, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Deutsche Bank and Barclays, according to documents obtained.<br />  Blackwater\u2019s owner and founder, Erik Prince \u2014 who has himself been linked to the CIA \u2014 helped train companies through two other firms he controlled: Total Intelligence Solutions and the Terrorism Research Center.

These secretive controllers\u00a0 have many arms, many disguises, but all are carefully controlled and working in concert\u2026although I\u2019m sure these evil forces have their differences, which would explain some of the discrepancies we see in the news.<br />  But they all converge at the apex of power and control somehow. Nasty bunch who don\u2019t flinch at eliminating each other either.<br />  It\u2019s also apparent the \u2018Powers That Be\u2019 love these \u2018free hands\u2019 of blindly committed \u2018crusaders\u2019 we\u2019ve described here to wreak havoc, vengeance, chaos, conflict, anything to justify their continued war on humanity until it\u2019s beaten into a fascist one world state of submission. Know, too, all the \u2018intelligence\u2019 agencies CIA, Mossad, MI6, ISI, etc. are all connected with these boys and many others, which is why it\u2019s so hard to clearly expose the perfidy of what\u2019s happening since they\u2019re all in it together in an unholy, strangely knotted alliance.<br />  Conclusion\u2026The Goal is to Terrorize, Divide and Conquer\u2013then Unite Under their \u2018Illumined Leadership\u2019<br />  So they hope. Evil cannot triumph in the long run\u2013they can only flail against the Truth which stands indomitable, inextinguishable and eternal. Their only temporal power is in fear and ignorance, which is why we need to do all we can to enlighten and empower those around us.<br />  And it\u2019s not all black and white, so don\u2019t expect complete clarity before taking action. Nor is there anything to get fearful about. Many of those on the inside want out, but cannot escape. Many are working to change this pattern, or alert their fellow man, such as the man who testified about Erik Prince. Look for it.\u00a0 We are the power. There are very few of them. All we need to do is wake up\u2013and stay awake. And alert others. We\u2019ll know what to do next.<br />  But we must be informed and connect these dots for ourselves. And this is only part of the picture.\u00a0 Once people realize it\u2019s not paranoia to realize there are very real agendas afoot, things start to clear up.<br />  Although it can be somewhat daunting at first\u2026<br />  \u201cSome of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\u201d \u2013 President Woodrow Wilson \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <br /><br />More information about this show available at: <a href=\"http://www.seattlecommunitymedia.org/node/228834\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seattle Community Media</a>", "identifier": "scm-228834-c4iformarch19stewshowsall", "subject": "Newsmagazine", "date": "2013-03-18", "collection": ["SeattleCommunityMedia", "community_media", "newsandpublicaffairs"], "runtime": "00:58:19", "addeddate": "2016-01-22 00:37:59", "creator": "Patricia Shupe  hostess, co-producer - scantv77@gmail.com  479-471-1895", "title": "C4I for March 19, Stew's news hits the fan.", "omp-locally-produced": "1"}
