Galileo will be the second planetary probe deployed\nfrom the Shuttle this year following Atlantis' successful launch of\nMagellan toward Venus exploration in May.\n\n     Following deployment about 6 hours after launch, Galileo will be\npropelled on a trajectory, known as Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist\n(VEEGA) by an Air Force-developed, inertial upper stage (IUS).  Galileo's\ntrajectory will swing around Venus, the sun and Earth before Galileo\nmakes it's way toward Jupiter.\n\n     Flying the VEEGA track, Galileo will arrive at Venus in February 1990.\nDuring the flyby, Galileo will make measurements to determine the\npresence of lightning on Venus and take time-lapse photography of Venus'\ncloud circulation patterns.  Accelerated by Venus' gravity, the spacecraft\nwill head back to Earth.\n\n     Enroute, Galileo will activate onboard remote-sensing equipment to\ngather near-infrared data on the composition and characteristics of the\nfar side of Earth's moon.  Galileo also will map the hydrogen distribution\nof the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n     Acquiring additional energy from the Earth's gravitational forces,\nGalileo will travel on a 2-year journey around the sun spending 10 months\ninside an asteroid belt.  On Oct. 29, 1991, Galileo wlll pass within 600\nmiles of the asteroid Gaspra.\n\n     On the second Earth flyby in December 1992, Galileo will photograph\nthe north pole of the moon in an effort to determine if ice exists.\nOutbound, Galileo will activate the time-lapse photography system to\nproduce a \"movie\" of the moon orbiting Earth.\n\n     Racing toward Jupiter, Galileo will make a second trek through the\nasteroid belt passing within 600 miles of asteroid Ida on Aug. 29, 1993.\nScience data gathered from both asteroid encounters will focus on surface\ngeology and composition.\n\n     Five months prior to the Dec. 7, 1995, arrival at Jupiter, Galileo's\natmospheric probe, encased in an oval heat shield, will spin away from the\norbiter at a rate of 5 revolutions per minute (rpm) and follow a ballistic\ntrajectory aimed at a spot 6 degrees north of Jupiter's equator.  The probe\nwill enter Jupiter's atmosphere at a shallow angle to avoid burning up like\na meteor or ricocheting off the atmosphere back into space.\n\n     At approximately Mach 1 speed, the probe's pilot parachute will deploy,\nremoving the deceleration module aft cover.  Deployment of the main\nparachute will follow, pulling the descent module out of the aeroshell to\nexpose the instrument-sensing elements.  During the 75-minute descent\ninto the Jovian atmosphere, the probe will use the orbiter to transmit\ndata back to Earth.  After 75 minutes, the probe will be crushed under the\nheavy atmospheric pressure.\n\n     The Galileo orbiter will continue its primary mission, orbiting around\nJupiter and four of its satellites, returning science data for the next 22\nmonths.\n\n     Galileo's scientific goals include the study of the chemical\ncomposition, state and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere and satellites,\nand the investigation of the structure and physical dynamics of the\npowerful Jovian magnetosphere.\n\n     Overall responsibility for management of the project, including orbiter\ndevelopment, resides at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,\nCalif.  The NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, Calif., manages\nthe probe system.  JPL built the 2,500-lb. spacecraft and Hughes Aircraft\nCo. built the 740-lb. probe.\n\n     Modifications made to Galileo since flight postponement in 1986\ninclude the addition of sunshields to the base and top of the antenna, new\nthermal control surfaces, blankets and heaters.  Because of the extended\nlength of the mission, the electrical circuitry of the thermoelectric\ngenerator has been revised to reduce power demand throughout the\nmission to assure adequate power supply for mission completion.\n\n     Joining Galileo in the payload bay of Atlantis will be the Shuttle Solar\nBackscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) instrument.  The SSBUV is designed to\nprovide calibration of backscatter ultraviolet instruments currently being\nflown on free-flying satellites.  SSBUV's primary objective is to check the\ncalibration of the ozone sounders on satellites to verify the accuracy of\nthe data set of atmospheric ozone and solar irradiance data.\n\n     The SSBUV is contained in two Get Away Special canisters in the\npayload bay and weighs about 1219 lbs .  One canister contains the SSBUV\nspectrometer and five supporting optical sensors.  The second canister\nhouses data, command and power systems.  An interconnecting cable\nprovides the communication link between the two canisters.\n\n     Atlantis also will carry several secondary payloads involving radiation\nmeasurements, polymer morphology, lightning research, microgravity\neffects on plants and a student experiment on ice crystal growth in space.\n\n     Commander of the 31st Shuttle mission is Donald E. Williams, Captain,\nUSN.  Michael J. McCulley, Commander, USN, is Pilot.  Williams flew as\nPilot of mission STS 51-D in April 1985.  McCulley will be making his\nfirst Shuttle flight.\n\n     Mission Specialists are Shannon W. Lucid, Ph.D.; Franklin R. Chang-Diaz,\nPh.D.; and Ellen S. Baker, M.D.   Lucid previously flew as a Mission\nSpecialist on STS 51-G in June 1985.  Chang-Diaz flew as a Mission\nSpecialist on STS 61-C in January 1986.  Baker is making her first Shuttle\nflight.\n\n     Liftoff of the fifth flight of orbiter Atlantis is scheduled for 1:29\np.m.EDT on Oct. 12 from Kennedy Space Center, Fla., launch pad 39-B, into a\n160-nautical-mile, 34.3-degree orbit.  Nominal mission duration is 5\ndays, 2 hours, 45 minutes.  Deorbit is planned on orbit 81, with landing\nscheduled for 4:14 p.m. EDT on Oct. 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.\n\n     Liftoff on Oct. 12 could occur during a 10-minute period.  The launch\nwindow grows each day reaching a maximum of 47 minutes on Nov. 2.  The\nwindow then decreases each day through the remainder of the launch\nopportunity which ends Nov. 21.  The window is dictated by the need for a\ndaylight landing opportunity at the trans-Atlantic landing abort sites and\nthe performance constraint of Galileo's inertial upper stage.\n\n     After landing at Edwards AFB, Atlantis will be towed to the NASA\nAmes-Dryden Flight Research Facility, hoisted atop the Shuttle Carrier\nAircraft and ferried back to the Kennedy Space Center to begin processing\nfor its next flight.\n\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n-------------------\n\nNASA Select Television Transmission\n\nNASA Select television is available on Satcom F-2R, Transponder 13,\nC-band located at 72 degrees west longitude, frequency 3960.0 MHz,\nvertical polarization, audio monaural 6.8 MHz.\n\nThe schedule for tv transmissions from the orbiter and for the\nchange-of-shift briefings from Johnson Space Center, Houston, will be\navailable during the mission at Kennedy Space Center, Fla.; Marshall Space\nFlight Center, Huntsville, Ala.; Johnson Space Center; and NASA\nHeadquarters, Washington, D.C.  The  schedule will be updated daily to\nreflect changes dictated by mission operations.\n\nTV schedules also may be obtained by calling COMSTOR, 713/483-5817.\nCOMSTOR is a computer data base service requiring the use of a telephone\nmodem.  Voice updates of the TV schedule may be obtained by dialing\n202/755-1788.  This service is updated daily at noon EDT.\n\n\nSpecial Note to Broadcasters\n\nIn the 5 workdays before launch, short sound bites of astronaut interviews\nwith the STS-34 crew will be available to broadcasters by calling\n202/755-1788 between 8 a.m. and noon EDT.\n\n\nStatus Reports\n\nStatus reports on countdown and mission progress, on-orbit activities and\nlanding operations will be produced by the appropriate NASA news center.\n\n\nBriefings\n\nAn STS-34 mission press briefing schedule will be issued prior to launch.\nDuring the mission, flight control personnel will be on 8-hour shifts.\nChange-of-shift briefings by the off-going flight director will occur at\napproximately 8-hour intervals.\n\n\n\nLAUNCH PREPARATIONS, COUNTDOWN AND LIFTOFF\n\n     Processing activities began on Atlantis for the STS-34 mission on May\n16 when Atlantis was towed to Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) bay 2\nafter arrival from NASA's Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility in\nCalifornia.  STS-30 post-flight deconfiguration and inspections were\nconducted in the processing hangar.\n\n     As planned, the three main engines were removed the last week of May\nand taken to the main engine shop in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB)\nfor the replacement of several components including the high pressure\noxidizer turbopumps. The engines were reinstalled  the first week of July,\nwhile the ship was in the OPF.  Engine 2027 is installed in the number one\nposition, engine 2030 is in the number two position and engine 2029 is in\nthe number three position.\n\n     The right hand Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pod was removed in\nmid-June for repairs.  A propellant tank needed for Atlantis' pod was\nscheduled for delivery too late to support integrated testing.  As a result,\nDiscovery's right pod was installed on Atlantis about 2 weeks later.  The\nleft OMS pod was removed July 9 and reinstalled 2 1/2 weeks later.  Both\npods had dynatubes and helium isolation valve repairs in the Hypergolic\nMaintenance Facility.\n\n      About 34 modifications have been implemented since the STS-30\nmission.  One significant modification is a cooling system for the\nradioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG).  The RTG fuel is  plutonium\ndioxide which generates heat as a result of its normal decay.  The heat is\nconverted to energy and used to provide electrical power for the Galileo\nspacecraft.  A mixture of alcohol and water flows in the special cooling\nsystem to lower the RTG case temperature and maintain a desired\ntemperature to the payload instrumentation in the vicinity of the RTGs.\nThese cooling lines are mounted on the port side of the orbiter from the\naft compartment to a control panel in bay 4.\n\n     Another modification, called \"flutter buffet,\" features special\ninstrumentation on the vertical tail and right and left outboard elevons.\nTen accelerometers were added to the vertical tail and one on each of the\nelevons.  These instruments are designed to measure in-flight loads on the\norbiter's structure.  Atlantis is the only vehicle that will be equipped with\nthis instrumentation.\n\n     Improved controllers for the water spray boilers and auxiliary power\nunits were installed.  Other improvements were made to the orbiter's\nstructure and thermal protection system, mechanical systems, propulsion\nsystem and avionics system.\n\n     Stacking of solid rocket motor (SRM) segments for flight began with\nthe left aft booster on Mobile Launcher Platform 1 in the VAB on June 15.\nBooster stacking operations were completed by July 22 and the external\ntank was mated to the two boosters on July 30.\n\n     Flight crew members performed the Crew Equipment Interface Test on\nJuly 29 to become familiar with Atlantis' crew compartment, vehicle\nconfiguration and equipment associated with the mission.\n\n     The Galileo probe arrived at the Spacecraft Assembly and\nEncapsulation Facility (SAEF) 2 on April 17 and the spacecraft arrived on\nMay 16.  While at SAEF-2, the spacecraft and probe were joined and tested\ntogether to verify critical connections.  Galileo was delivered to the\nVertical Processing Facility (VPF) on Aug. 1.  The Inertial Upper Stage\n(IUS) was delivered to the VPF on July 30.  The Galileo/IUS were joined\ntogether on Aug. 3 and all integrated testing was performed during the\nsecond week of August.\n\n     The Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) experiment,\ncontained in two Get Away Special (GAS) canisters, was mounted on a\nspecial GAS beam in Atlantis' payload bay on July 24.  Interface\nverification tests were performed the next day.\n\n     Atlantis was transferred from the OPF to the VAB on Aug. 21, where it\nwas mated to the external tank and SRBs.  A Shuttle Interface Test was\nconducted in the VAB to check the mechanical and electrical connections\nbetween the various elements of the Shuttle vehicle and onboard flight\nsystems.\n\n     The assembled Space Shuttle vehicle was rolled out of the VAB aboard\nits mobile launcher platform for the 4.2 mile trip to Launch Pad 39-B on\nAug. 29.  Galileo and its IUS upper stage were transferred from the VPF to\nLaunch Pad 39-B on Aug. 25.  The payload was installed in Atlantis'\npayload bay on Aug. 30.\n\n     The payload interface verification test was planned for Sept. 7 to\nverify connections between the Shuttle and the payload.  An end-to-end\ntest was planned for Sept. 8 to verify communications between the\nspacecraft and ground controllers.  Testing of the IUS was planned about 2\nweeks prior to launch in parallel with Shuttle launch preparations.\n\n     A Countdown Demonstration Test, a dress rehearsal for the STS-34\nflight crew and KSC launch team, is designed as a practice countdown for\nthe launch.  At press time, it was planned for Sept. 14 and 15.\n\n     One of the unique STS-34 processing milestones planned was a\nsimulation exercise for the installation of the RTGs.  Simulated RTGs\nwere to be used in the 2-day event scheduled within the first week after\nAtlantis arrives at the launch pad.  The test is designed to give workers\nexperience for the installation of the RTGs, a first in the Shuttle program.\nIn addition, access requirements will be identified and procedures will be\nverified.\n\n     Another test scheduled at the pad is installation of the flight RTGs and\nan associated test and checkout of the RTG cooling system planned for the\nthird week of September.  This test will verify the total RTG cooling\nsystem and connections.  The RTGs will be removed at the completion of\nthe 3-day cooling system test and returned to the RTG facility.  The two\nflight RTGs will be reinstalled on the spacecraft 6 days before launch.\n\nLaunch preparations scheduled the last 2 weeks prior to launch countdown\ninclude final vehicle ordnance activities, such as power-on stray-voltage\nchecks and resistance checks of firing circuits; loading the fuel cell\nstorage tanks; pressurizing the hypergolic propellant tanks aboard the\nvehicle; final payload closeouts; and a final functional check of the range\nsafety and SRB ignition, safe and arm devices.\n\nThe launch countdown is scheduled to pick up at the T-minus 43-hour\nmark, leading up to the STS-34 launch.  Atlantis' fifth launch will be\nconducted by a joint NASA/industry team from Firing Room 1 in the Launch\nControl Center.\n\n\nMAJOR COUNTDOWN MILESTONES\n\nCountdown                        Event\n\nT-43 Hours      Power up Space Shuttle vehicle.\n\nT-34 Hours      Begin orbiter and ground support\n                equipment closeouts for launch.\n\nT-30 Hours      Activate orbiter's navigation aids.\n\nT-27 Hours (holding)    Enter first built-in hold for 8 hours.\n\nT-27 Hours (counting)   Begin preparations for loading fuel\n                        cell storage tanks with liquid oxygen\n                        and liquid hydrogen reactants.\n\nT-25 Hours      Load orbiter's fuel cell tanks with liquid oxygen.\n\nT-22 Hours, 30 minutes  Load orbiter's fuel cell tanks with liquid hydrogen.\n\nT-22 Hours      Perform interface check between\n                Houston Mission Control and Merritt\n                Island  Launch Area (MILA) tracking\n                station.\n\nT-20 Hours      Activate and warm up inertial\n                measurement units (IMU).\n\nT-19 Hours (holding)    Enter 8-hour built-in hold.

Abort modes include:\n\n* Abort-To-Orbit (ATO) -- Partial loss of main engine thrust late enough to\npermit reaching a minimal 105-nautical mile orbit with orbital\nmaneuvering system engines.\n\n* Abort-Once-Around (AOA) -- Earlier main engine shutdown with the\ncapability to allow one orbit around before landing at Edwards Air Force\nBase, Calif.; White Sands Space Harbor (Northrup Strip), N.M.; or the\nShuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Fla.\n\n* Trans-Atlantic Abort Landing (TAL) -- Loss of two main engines midway\nthrough powered flight would force a landing at Ben Guerir, Morocco; Moron,\nSpain; or Banjul, The Gambia.\n\n* Return-To-Launch-Site (RTLS) -- Early shutdown of one or more engines\nand without enough energy to reach Ben Guerir, would result in a pitch\naround and thrust back toward KSC until within gliding distance of the SLF.\n\n\nSTS-34 contingency landing sites are Edwards AFB, White Sands, KSC, Ben</font> <br /><br /><font face=\"courier\"><b>Text found in Volume_300_Galileo_Space_Disk.dsk/STS.34.PART.2.txt:</b><br /><br />\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR ACTIVITIES\n---------------------------\n\nDay One\n-------\n\nAscent\nPost-insertion checkout\nPre-deploy checkout\nGalileo/Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) deploy\nDetailed Secondary Objective (DSO)\nPolymer Morphology (PM)\nSensor Technology Experiment (STEX) activation\n\n\nDay Two\n-------\nGalileo/IUS backup deploy opportunity\nDSO\nIMAX\nPM\nShuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) activation\nShuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP)\n\n\nDay Three\n---------\n\nDSO\nIMAX\nMesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE)\nPM\n\n\nDay Four\n--------\n\nDSO\nIMAX\nMLE\nPM\nSSBUV deactivation\n\n\nDay Five\n--------\n\nDTO/DSO\nGHCD operations\nPM\nSTEX deactivation\nFlight control systems (FCS) checkout\nCabin stow\nLanding preparations\n\n\nDay Six\n-------\n\nPM stow\nDeorbit preparation\nDeorbit burn\nLanding at Edwards AFB\n\n\n\n\n\nLANDING AND POST LANDING OPERATIONS\n\n     Kennedy Space Center, Fla., is responsible for ground  operations of the\norbiter once it has rolled to a stop on the runway at Edwards Air Force\nBase, Calif.  Those operations include preparing the Shuttle for the return\ntrip to Kennedy.\n\n     After landing, the flight crew aboard Atlantis begins \"safing\" vehicle\nsystems.  Immediately after wheel stop, specially garbed technicians will\nfirst determine that any residual hazardous vapors are below significant\nlevels for other safing operations to proceed.\n\n     A mobile white room is moved into place around the crew hatch once it\nis verified that there are no concentrations of toxic gases around the\nforward part of the vehicle.  The flight crew is expected to leave Atlantis\nabout 45 to 50 minutes after landing.  As the crew exits, technicians enter\nthe orbiter to complete the vehicle safing activity.\n\n     Once the initial aft safety assessment is made, access vehicles  are\npositioned  around the rear of the orbiter so that lines from the ground\npurge and cooling vehicles can be connected to the umbilical panels on the\naft end of Atlantis.\n\n     Freon line connections are completed and coolant begins circulating\nthrough the umbilicials to aid in heat rejection and protect the orbiter's\nelectronic equipment.  Other lines provide cooled, humidified air to the\npayload bay and other cavities to remove any residual fumes and provide a\nsafe environment inside Atlantis.\n\n     A tow tractor will be connected to Atlantis and the vehicle will be\npulled off the runway at Edwards and positioned inside the Mate/Demate\nDevice (MDD) at nearby Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility.  After the\nShuttle has been jacked and leveled, residual fuel cell cryogenics are\ndrained and unused pyrotechnic devices are disconnected prior to returning\nthe orbiter to Kennedy.\n\n     The aerodynamic tail cone is installed over the three main engines,\nand the orbiter is bolted on top of the 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the\nferry flight back to Florida.  Pending completion of planned work and\nfavorable weather conditions, the 747 would depart California about 6 days\nafter landing for the cross-country ferry flight back to Florida.  A\nrefueling stop is necessary to complete the journey.\n\n    Once back at Kennedy, Atlantis will be pulled inside the hangar-like\nfacility for post-flight inspections and in-flight anomaly troubleshooting.\nThese operations are conducted in parallel with the start of routine\nsystems reverification to prepare Atlantis for its next mission.\n\n\nGALILEO\n-------\n\n     Galileo is a NASA spacecraft mission to Jupiter to study the planet's\natmosphere, satellites and surrounding magnetosphere.  It was named for\nthe Italian renaissance scientist who discovered Jupiter's major moons by\nusing the first astronomical telescope.\n\n     This mission will be the first to make direct measurements from an\ninstrumented probe within Jupiter's atmosphere and the first to conduct\nlong-term observations of the planet and its magnetosphere and satellites\nfrom orbit around Jupiter.  It will be the first orbiter and atmospheric\nprobe for any of the outer planets.  On the way to Jupiter, Galileo also will\nobserve Venus, the Earth-moon system, one or two asteroids and various\nphenomena in interplanetary space.\n\n     Galileo will be boosted into low-Earth orbit by the Shuttle Atlantis and\nthen boosted out of Earth orbit by a solid rocket Inertial Upper Stage.  The\nspacecraft will fly past Venus and twice by the Earth, using gravity assists\nfrom the planets to pick up enough speed to reach Jupiter.  Travel time from\nlaunch to Jupiter is a little more than 6 years.\n\n     In December 1995, the Galileo atmospheric probe will conduct a brief,\ndirect examination of Jupiter's atmosphere, while the larger part of the\ncraft, the orbiter, begins a 22-month, 10-orbit tour of major satellites and\nthe magnetosphere, including long-term observations of Jupiter throughout\nthis phase.\n\n     The 2-ton Galileo orbiter spacecraft carries 9 scientific instruments.\nThere are another six experiments on the 750-pound probe.  The spacecraft\nradio link to Earth serves as an additional instrument for  scientific\nmeasurements.  The probe's scientific data will be relayed to Earth by the\norbiter during the 75-minute period while the probe is descending into\nJupiter's atmosphere.  Galileo will communicate with its controllers and\nscientists through NASAUs Deep Space Network, using tracking stations in\nCalifornia, Spain and Australia.\n\n\n\nGALILEO MISSION EVENTS\n----------------------\n\n\nLaunch Window (Atlantis and IUS)        Oct. 12 to Nov. 21, 1989\n(Note:  for both asteroids, closes in mid-October)\n\nVenus flyby ( 9,300 mi) *Feb. 9, 1990\nVenus data playback     Oct. 1990\nEarth 1 flyby ( about 600 mi)   *Dec. 8, 1990\nAsteroid Gaspra flyby (600 mi)  *Oct. 29, 1991\nEarth 2 flyby (200 mi)  *Dec. 8, 1992\nAsteroid Ida flyby (600 mi)     *Aug. 28, 1993\nProbe release   July 1995\nJupiter arrival Dec. 7, 1995\n\n(includes Io flyby, probe entry and relay, Jupiter orbit insertion)\n\nOrbital tour of Galilean satellites     Dec '95-Oct '97\n\n*Exact dates may vary according to actual launch date\n\n\n\n\nEARTH TO JUPITER\n----------------\n\n     Galileo will make three planetary encounters in the course of its\ngravity-assisted flight to Jupiter.  These provide opportunities for\nscientific observation and measurement of Venus and the Earth-moon\nsystem.  The mission also has a chance to fly close to one or two asteroids,\nbodies which have never been observed close up, and obtain data on other\nphenomena of interplanetary space.\n\n     Scientists are currently studying how to use the Galileo scientific\ninstruments and the limited ability to collect, store and transmit data\nduring the early phase of flight to make the best use of these opportunities.\nInstruments designed to observe Jupiter's atmosphere from afar can\nimprove our knowledge of the atmosphere of Venus and sensors designed for\nthe study of Jupiter's moons can add to our information about our own moon.\n\n\nVENUS\n-----\n     The Galileo spacecraft will approach Venus early in 1990 from the night\nside and pass across the sunlit hemisphere, allowing observation of the\nclouds and atmosphere.  Both infrared and ultraviolet spectral observations\nare planned, as well as several camera images and other remote\nmeasurements.  The search for deep cloud patterns and for lightning storms\nwill be limited by the fact that all the Venus data must be tape-recorded on\nthe spacecraft for playback 8 months later.\n\n     The spacecraft was originally designed to operate between Earth and\nJupiter, where sunlight is 25 times weaker than at Earth and temperatures\nare much lower.  The VEEGA mission will expose the spacecraft to a hotter\nenvironment from Earth to Venus and back.  Spacecraft engineers devised a\nset of sunshades to protect the craft.  For this system to work, the front\nend of the spacecraft must be aimed precisely at the Sun, with the main\nantenna furled for protection from the Sun's rays until after the first Earth\nflyby in December 1990.  This precludes the use of the Galileo high-gain\nantenna and therefore, scientists must wait until the spacecraft is close to\nEarth to receive the recorded Venus data, transmitted through a low-gain\nantenna.\n\n\nFIRST EARTH PASS\n----------------\n\n     Approaching Earth for the first time about 14 months after launch, the\nGalileo spacecraft will observe, from a distance, the nightside of Earth and\nparts of both the sunlit and unlit sides of the moon.  After passing Earth,\nGalileo will observe Earth's sunlit side.  At this short range, scientific data\nare transmitted at the high rate using only the spacecraft's low-gain\nantennas.  The high-gain antenna is to be unfurled like an umbrella, and its\nhigh-power transmitter turned on and checked out, about 5 months after the\nfirst Earth encounter.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST ASTEROID\n--------------\n     Nine months after the Earth passage and still in an elliptical solar\norbit, Galileo will enter the asteroid belt, and two months later, will\nhave its first asteroid encounter.  Gaspra is believed to be a fairly\nrepresentative main-belt asteroid, about 10 miles across and probably\nsimilar in composition to stony meteorites.\n\n     The spacecraft will pass within about 600 miles at a relative speed of\nabout 18,000 miles per hour.  It will collect several pictures of Gaspra and\nmake spectral measurements to indicate its composition and physical\nproperties.\n\n\n\nSECOND EARTH PASS\n-----------------\n     Thirteen months after the Gaspra encounter, the spacecraft will have\ncompleted its 2-year elliptical orbit around the Sun and will arrive back at\nEarth.  It will need a much larger ellipse (with a 6-year period) to reach as\nfar as Jupiter.  The second flyby of Earth will pump the orbit up to that\nsize, acting as a natural apogee kick motor for the Galileo spacecraft.\n\n    Passing about 185 miles above the surface, near the altitude at which it\nhad been deployed from the Space Shuttle almost three years earlier,\nGalileo will use Earth's gravitation to change the spacecraft's flight\ndirection and pick up about 8,000 miles per hour in speed.\n\n    Each gravity-assist flyby requires about three rocket-thrusting\nsessions, using Galileo's onboard retropropulsion module, to fine-tune the\nflight path.  The asteroid encounters require similar maneuvers to obtain\nthe best observing conditions.\n\n     Passing the Earth for the last time, the spacecraft's scientific\nequipment will make thorough observations of the planet, both for\ncomparison with Venus and Jupiter and to aid in Earth studies.  If all goes\nwell, there is a good chance that Galileo will enable scientists to record\nthe motion of the moon about the Earth while the Earth itself rotates.\n\n\nSECOND ASTEROID\n----------------\n\n     Nine months after the final Earth flyby, Galileo may have a second\nasteroid-observing opportunity.  Ida is about 20 miles across.  Like Gaspra,\nIda is believed to represent the majority of main-belt asteroids in\ncomposition, though there are believed to be differences between the two.\nRelative velocity for this flyby will be nearly 28,000 miles per hour, with a\nplanned closest approach of about 600 miles.\n\n\n\n\nAPPROACHING JUPITER\n-------------------\n\n     Some 2 years after leaving Earth for the third time and 5 months before\nreaching Jupiter, Galileo's probe must separate from the orbiter.  The\nspacecraft turns to aim the probe precisely for its entry point in the\nJupiter atmosphere, spins up to 10 revolutions per minute and releases the\nspin-stabilized probe.  Then the Galileo orbiter maneuvers again to aim for\nits own Jupiter encounter and resumes its scientific measurements of the\ninterplanetary environment underway since the launch more than 5 years\nbefore.\n\n     While the probe is still approaching Jupiter, the orbiter will have its\nfirst two satellite encounters.  After passing within 20,000 miles of\nEuropa, it will fly about 600 miles above Io's volcano-torn surface, twenty\ntimes closer than the closest flyby altitude of Voyager in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\nAT JUPITER\n----------\n\nThe Probe at Jupiter\n\n     The probe mission has four phases:  launch, cruise, coast and\nentry-descent.  During launch and cruise, the probe will be carried by the\norbiter and serviced by a common umbilical.  The probe will be dormant\nduring cruise except for annual checkouts of spacecraft systems and\ninstruments.  During this period, the orbiter will provide the probe with\nelectric power, commands, data transmission and some thermal control.\n\n     Six hours before entering the atmosphere, the probe will be shooting\nthrough space at about 40,000 mph.  At this time, its command unit signals\n\"wake up\" and instruments begin collecting data on lightning, radio\nemissions and energetic particles.\n\n     A few hours later, the probe will slam into Jupiter's atmosphere at\n115,000 mph, fast enough to jet from Los Angeles to New York in 90\nseconds.  Deceleration to about Mach 1 -- the speed of sound -- should take\njust a few minutes.  At maximum deceleration as the craft slows from\n115,000 mph to 100 mph, it will be hurtling against a force 350 times\nEarth's gravity.  The incandescent shock wave ahead of the probe will be as\nbright as the sun and reach searing temperatures of up to 28,000 degrees\nFahrenheit.  After the aerodynamic braking has slowed the probe, it will\ndrop its heat shields and deploy its parachute.  This will allow the probe to\nfloat down about 125 miles through the clouds, passing from a pressure of\n1/10th that on Earth's surface to about 25 Earth atmospheres.\n\n     About 4 minutes after probe entry into Jupiter's atmosphere, a pilot\nchute deploys and explosive nuts shoot off the top section of the probe's\nprotective shell.  As the cover whips away, it pulls out and opens the main\nparachute attached to the inner capsule.  What remains of the probe's outer\nshell, with its massive heat shield, falls away as the parachute slows the\ninstrument module.\n\n   From there on, suspended from the main parachute, the probe's capsule\nwith its activated instruments floats downward toward the bright clouds\nbelow.\n\n     The probe will pass through the white cirrus clouds of ammonia crystals\n- the highest cloud deck.  Beneath this ammonia layer probably lie\nreddish-brown clouds of ammonium hydrosulfides.  Once past this layer, the\nprobe is expected to reach thick water clouds.  This lowest cloud layer may\nact as a buffer between the uniformly mixed regions below and the\nturbulent swirl of gases above.\n\n     Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily hydrogen and helium.  For most of its\ndescent through Jupiter's three main cloud layers, the probe will be\nimmersed in gases at or below room temperature.  However, it may\nencounter hurricane winds up to 200 mph and lightning and heavy rain at the\nbase of the water clouds believed to exist on the planet.  Eventually, the\nprobe will sink below these clouds, where rising pressure and temperature\nwill destroy it.  The probe's active life in Jupiter's atmosphere is expected\nto be about 75 minutes in length.  The probe batteries are not expected to\nlast beyond this point, and the relaying orbiter will move out of reach.\n\n     To understand this huge gas planet, scientists must find out about its\nchemical components and the dynamics of its atmosphere.  So far,\nscientific data are limited to a two-dimensional view (pictures of the\nplanet's cloud tops) of a three-dimensional process (Jupiter's weather).  But\nto explore such phenomena as the planet's incredible coloring, the Great Red\nSpot and the swirling shapes and high-speed motion of its topmost clouds,\nscientists must penetrate Jupiter's visible surface and investigate the\natmosphere concealed in the deep-lying layers below.\n\n     A set of six scientific instruments on the probe will measure, among\nother things, the radiation field near Jupiter, the temperature, pressure,\ndensity and composition of the planet's atmosphere from its first faint\nouter traces to the hot, murky hydrogen atmosphere 100 miles below the\ncloud tops.  All of the information will be gathered during the probe's\ndescent on an 8-foot parachute.  Probe data will be sent to the Galileo\nOrbiter 133,000 miles overhead then relayed across the half billion miles\nto Deep Space Network stations on Earth.\n\n     To return its science, the probe relay radio aboard the orbiter must\nautomatically acquire the probe signal below within 50 seconds, with a\nsuccess probability of 99.5 percent.  It must reacquire the signal\nimmediately should it become lost.\n\n     To survive the heat and pressure of entry, the probe spacecraft is\ncomposed of two separate units:  an inner capsule containing the scientific\ninstruments, encased in a virtually impenetrable outer shell.  The probe\nweighs 750 pounds.  The outer shell is almost all heat shield material.\n\n\n\nThe Orbiter at Jupiter\n----------------------\n\n     After releasing the probe, the orbiter will use its main engine to go into\norbit around Jupiter.  This orbit, the first of 10 planned, will have a period\nof about 8 months.  A close flyby of Ganymede in July 1996 will shorten the\norbit, and each time the Galileo orbiter returns to the inner zone of\nsatellites, it will make a gravity-assist close pass over one or another of\nthe satellites, changing Galileo's orbit while making close observations.\nThese satellite encounters will be at altitudes as close as 125 miles above\ntheir surfaces.  Throughout the 22-month orbital phase, Galileo will\ncontinue observing the planet and the satellites and continue gathering data\non the magnetospheric environment.\n\n\n\nSCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES\n---------------------\n\n     Galileo's scientific experiments will be carried out by more than 100\nscientists from six nations.  Except for the radio science investigation,\nthese are supported by dedicated instruments on the Galileo orbiter and\nprobe.  NASA has appointed 15 interdisciplinary scientists whose studies\ninclude data from more than one Galileo instrument.\n\n      The instruments aboard the probe will measure the temperatures and\npressure of Jupiter's atmosphere at varying altitudes and determine its\nchemical composition including major and minor constituents (such as\nhydrogen, helium, ammonia, methane, and water) and the ratio of hydrogen\nto helium.  Jupiter is thought to have a bulk composition similar to that of\nthe primitive solar nebula from which it was formed.  Precise\ndetermination of the ratio of hydrogen to helium would provide an\nimportant factual check of the Big Bang theory of the genesis of the\nuniverse.\n\n     Other probe experiments will determine the location and structure of\nJupiter's clouds, the existence and nature of its lightning, and the amount\nof heat radiating from the planet compared to the heat absorbed from\nsunlight.\n\n     In addition, measurements will be made of Jupiter's numerous radio\nemissions and of the high-energy particles trapped in the planet's\ninnermost magnetic field.  These measurements for Galileo will be made\nwithin a distance of 26,000 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops, far closer than\nthe previous closest approach to Jupiter by Pioneer 11.  The probe also will\ndetermine vertical wind shears using Doppler radio measurements made of\nprobe motions from the radio receiver aboard the orbiter.\n\n     Jupiter appears to radiate about twice as much energy as it receives\nfrom the sun and the resulting convection currents from Jupiter's internal\nheat source towards its cooler polar regions could explain some of the\nplanet's unusual weather patterns.\n\n     Jupiter is over 11 times the diameter of Earth and spins about two and\none-half times faster -- a jovian day is only 10 hours long.  A point on the\nequator of Jupiter's visible surface races along at 28,000 mph.  This rapid\nspin may account for many of the bizarre circulation patterns observed on\nthe planet.\n\n\nSpacecraft Scientific Activities\n--------------------------------\n\n     The Galileo mission and systems were designed to investigate three\nbroad aspects of the Jupiter system: the planet's atmosphere, the satellites\nand the magnetosphere.  The spacecraft is in three segments to focus on\nthese areas: the atmospheric probe; a non-spinning section of the orbiter\ncarrying cameras and other remote sensors; and the spinning main section\nof the orbiter spacecraft which includes the propulsion module, the\ncommunications antennas, main computers and most support systems as\nwell as the fields and particles instruments, which sense and measure the\nenvironment directly as the spacecraft flies through it.\n\n\n\nProbe Scientific Activities\n---------------------------\n\n     The probe will enter the atmosphere about 6 degrees north of the\nequator.  The probe weighs just under 750 pounds and includes a\ndeceleration module to slow and protect the descent module, which carries\nout the scientific mission.\n\n     The deceleration module consists of an aeroshell and an aft cover\ndesigned to block the heat generated by slowing from the probe's arrival\nspeed of about 115,000 miles per hour to subsonic speed in less than 2\nminutes.  After the covers are released, the descent module deploys its\n8-foot  parachute and its instruments, the control and data system, and the\nradio-relay transmitter go to work.\n\n     Operating at 128 bits per second, the dual L-band transmitters send\nnearly identical streams of scientific data to the orbiter.  The probe's relay\nradio aboard the orbiter will have two redundant receivers that process\nprobe science data, plus radio science and engineering data for\ntransmission to the orbiter communications system.  Minimum received\nsignal strength is 31 dBm.  The receivers also measure signal strength and\nDoppler shift as part of the experiments for measuring wind speeds and\natmospheric absorption of radio signals.\n\n     Probe electronics are powered by long-life, high-discharge-rate 34-volt\nlithium batteries, which remain dormant for more than 5 years during the\njourney to Jupiter.  The batteries have an estimated capacity of about 18\namp-hours on arrival at Jupiter.\n\n\n\nOrbiter Scientific Activities\n-----------------------------\n\n     The orbiter, in addition to delivering the probe to Jupiter and relaying\nprobe data to Earth, will support all the scientific investigations of Venus,\nthe Earth and moon, asteroids and the interplanetary medium, Jupiter's\nsatellites and magnetosphere, and observation of the giant planet itself.\n\n     The orbiter weighs about 5,200 pounds including about 2,400 pounds of\nrocket propellant to be expended in some 30 relatively small maneuvers\nduring the long gravity-assisted flight to Jupiter, the large thrust\nmaneuver which puts the craft into its Jupiter orbit, and the 30 or so trim\nmaneuvers planned for the satellite tour phase.\n\n     The retropropulsion module consists of 12 10-newton thrusters, a single\n400-newton engine, and the fuel, oxidizer, and pressurizing-gas tanks,\ntubing, valves and control equipment.  (A thrust of 10 newtons would\nsupport a weight of about 2.2 pounds at Earth's surface).  The propulsion\nsystem was developed and built by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm and\nprovided by the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n     The orbiter's maximum communications rate is 134 kilobits per second\n(the equivalent of about one black-and-white image per minute); there are\nother data rates, down to 10 bits per second, for transmitting engineering\ndata under poor conditions.  The spacecraft transmitters operate at S-band\nand X-band (2295 and 8415 megahertz) frequencies between Earth and on\nL-band between the probe.\n\n     The high-gain antenna is a 16-foot umbrella-like reflector unfurled\nafter the first Earth flyby.  Two low-gain antennas (one pointed forward\nand one aft, both mounted on the spinning section) are provided to support\ncommunications during the Earth-Venus-Earth leg of the flight and\nwhenever the main antenna is not deployed and pointed at Earth.  The despun\nsection of the orbiter carries a radio relay antenna for receiving the probe's\ndata transmissions.\n\n     Electrical power is provided to Galileo's equipment by two radioisotope\nthermoelectric generators.  Heat produced by natural radioactive decay of\nplutonium 238 dioxide is converted to approximately 500 watts of\nelectricity (570 watts at launch, 480 at the end of the mission) to operate\nthe orbiter equipment for its 8-year active period.  This is the same type of\npower source used by the Voyager and Pioneer Jupiter spacecraft in their\nlong outer-planet missions, by the Viking lander spacecraft on Mars and the\nlunar scientific packages left on the Moon.\n\n     Most spacecraft are stabilized in flight either by spinning around a\nmajor axis or by maintaining a fixed orientation in space, referenced to the\nsun and another star.  Galileo represents a hybrid of these techniques, with\na spinning section rotating ordinarily at 3 rpm and a \"despun\" section which\nis counter-rotated to provide a fixed orientation for cameras and other\nremote sensors.\n\n     Instruments that measure fields and particles, together with the main\nantenna, the power supply, the propulsion module, most of the computers\nand control electronics, are mounted on the spinning section.  The\ninstruments include magnetometer sensors mounted on a 36-foot boom to\nescape interference from the spacecraft; a plasma instrument detecting\nlow-energy charged particles and a plasma-wave detector to study waves\ngenerated in planetary magnetospheres and by lightning discharges; a\nhigh-energy particle detector; and a detector of cosmic and Jovian dust.\n\n     The despun section carries instruments and other equipment whose\noperation depends on a fixed orientation in space.  The instruments include\nthe camera system; the near-infrared mapping spectrometer to make\nmultispectral images for atmosphere and surface chemical analysis; the\nultraviolet spectrometer to study gases and ionized gases; and the\nphotopolarimeter radiometer to measure radiant and reflected energy.  The\ncamera system is expected to obtain images of Jupiter's satellites at\nresolutions from 20 to 1,000 times better than Voyager's best.\n\n     This section also carries a dish antenna to track the probe in Jupiter's\natmosphere and pick up its signals for relay to Earth.  The probe is carried\non the despun section, and before it is released, the whole spacecraft is\nspun up briefly to 10 rpm in order to spin-stabilize the probe.\n\n     The Galileo spacecraft will carry out its complex operations, including\nmaneuvers, scientific observations and communications, in response to\nstored sequences which are interpreted and executed by various on-board\ncomputers.  These sequences are sent up to the orbiter periodically through\nthe Deep Space Network in the form of command loads.\n\n\n\nGROUND SYSTEMS\n--------------\n\n     Galileo communicates with Earth via NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN),\nwhich has a complex of large antennas with receivers and transmitters\nlocated in the California desert, another in Australia and a third in Spain,\nlinked to a network control center at NASAUs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in\nPasadena, Calif.  The spacecraft receives commands, sends science and\nengineering data, and is tracked by Doppler and ranging measurements\nthrough this network.\n\n At JPL, about 275 scientists, engineers and technicians, will be supporting\nthe mission at launch, increasing to nearly 400 for Jupiter operations\nincluding support from the German retropropulsion team at their control\ncenter in the FGR.  Their responsibilities include spacecraft command,\ninterpreting engineering and scientific data from Galileo to understand its\nperformance, and analyzing navigation data from the DSN.  The controllers\nuse a set of complex computer programs to help them control the\nspacecraft and interpret the data.\n\n     Because the time delay in radio signals from Earth to Jupiter and back is\nmore than an hour, the Galileo spacecraft was designed to operate from\nprograms sent to it in advance and stored in spacecraft memory.  A single\nmaster sequence program can cover 4 weeks of quiet operations between\nplanetary and satellite encounters.  During busy Jupiter operations, one\nprogram covers only a few days.  Actual spacecraft tasks are carried out by\nseveral subsystems and scientific instruments, many of which work from\ntheir own computers controlled by the main sequence.\n\n     Designing these sequences is a complex process balancing the desire to\nmake certain scientific observations with the need to safeguard the\nspacecraft and mission.  The sequence design process itself is supported by\nsoftware programs, for example, which display to the scientist maps of the\ninstrument coverage on the surface of an approaching satellite for a given\nspacecraft orientation and trajectory.  Notwithstanding these aids, a\ntypical 3-day satellite encounter may take efforts spread over many\nmonths to design, check and recheck.  The controllers also use software\ndesigned to check the command sequence further against flight rules and\nconstraints.\n\n     The spacecraft regularly reports its status and health through an\nextensive set of engineering measurements.  Interpreting these data into\ntrends and averting or working around equipment failures is a major task\nfor the mission operations team.  Conclusions from this activity become an\nimportant input, along with scientific plans, to the sequence design\nprocess.  This too is supported by computer programs written and used in\nthe mission support area.\n\nNavigation is the process of estimating, from radio range and Doppler\nmeasurements, the position and velocity of the spacecraft to predict its\nflight path and design course-correcting maneuvers.  These calculations\nmust be done with computer support.  The Galileo mission, with its complex\ngravity-assist flight to Jupiter and 10 gravity-assist satellite encounters\nin the Jovian system, is extremely dependent on consistently accurate\nnavigation.\n\n     In addition to the programs that directly operate the spacecraft and are\nperiodically transmitted to it, the mission operations team uses software\namounting to 650,000 lines of programming code in the sequence design\nprocess; 1,615,000 lines in the telemetry interpretation; and 550,000 lines\nof code in navigation.  These must all be written, checked, tested, used in\nmission simulations and, in many cases, revised before the mission can\nbegin.\n\nScience investigators are located at JPL or other university laboratories\nand linked by computers.  From any of these locations, the scientists can be\ninvolved in developing the sequences affecting their experiments and, in\nsome cases, in helping to change preplanned sequences to follow up on\nunexpected discoveries with second looks and confirming observations.</font> <br /><br /><font face=\"courier\"><b>Text found in Volume_300_Galileo_Space_Disk.dsk/STS.34.PART.3.txt:</b><br /><br />JUPITER'S SYSTEM\n\n     Jupiter is the largest and fastest-spinning planet in the solar system.\nIts radius is more than 11 times Earth's, and its mass is 318 times that of\nour planet.  Named for the chief of the Roman gods, Jupiter contains more\nmass than all the other planets combined.  It is made mostly of light\nelements, principally hydrogen and helium.  Its atmosphere and clouds are\ndeep and dense, and a significant amount of energy is emitted from its\ninterior.\n\n     The earliest Earth-based telescopic observations showed bands and\nspots in Jupiter's atmosphere.  One storm system, the Red Spot, has been\nseen to persist over three centuries.\n\n     Atmospheric forms and dynamics were observed in increasing detail\nwith the Pioneer and Voyager flyby spacecraft, and Earth-based infrared\nastronomers have recently studied the nature and vertical dynamics of\ndeeper clouds.\n\n     Sixteen satellites are known.  The four largest, discovered by the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1610, are the size of small planets.  The innermost of these, Io, has active sulfurous volcanoes, discovered by\nVoyager 1 and further observed by Voyager 2 and Earth-based infrared\nastronomy.  Io and Europa are about the size and density of Earth's moon (3\nto 4 times the density of water) and probably rocky inside.  Ganymede and\nCallisto, further out from Jupiter, are the size of Mercury but less than\ntwice as dense as water.  Their cratered surfaces look icy in Voyager\nimages, and they may be composed partly of ice or water.\n\n     Of the other satellites, eight (probably captured asteroids) orbit\nirregularly far from the planet, and four (three discovered by the Voyager\nmission in 1979) are close to the planet.  Voyager also discovered a thin\nring system at Jupiter in 1979.\n\n     Jupiter has the strongest planetary magnetic field known.  The resulting\nmagnetosphere is a huge teardrop-shaped, plasma-filled cavity in the solar\nwind pointing away from the sun.  JupiterUs magnetosphere is the largest\nsingle entity in our solar system, measuring more than 14 times the\ndiameter of the sun.  The inner part of the magnetic field is doughnut-\nshaped, but farther out it flattens into a disk.  The magnetic poles are\noffset and tilted relative to Jupiter's axis of rotation, so the field appears\nto wobble with Jupiter's rotation (just under 10 hours), sweeping up and\ndown across the inner satellites and making waves throughout the\nmagnetosphere.\n\n\nWHY JUPITER INVESTIGATIONS ARE IMPORTANT\n\n     With a thin skin of turbulent winds and brilliant, swift-moving clouds,\nthe huge sphere of Jupiter is a vast sea of liquid hydrogen and helium.\nJupiter's composition (about 88 percent hydrogen and 11 percent helium\nwith small amounts of methane, ammonia and water) is thought to resemble\nthe makeup of the solar nebula, the cloud of gas and dust from which the\nsun and planets formed.  Scientists believe Jupiter holds important clues to\nconditions in the early solar system and the process of planet formation.\n\n     Jupiter may also provide insights into the formation of the universe\nitself.  Since it resembles the interstellar gas and dust  that are thought to\nhave been created in the \"Big Bang,\" studies of Jupiter may help scientists\ncalibrate models of the beginning of the universe.\n\n     Though starlike in composition, Jupiter is too small to generate\ntemperatures high enough to ignite nuclear fusion, the process that powers\nthe stars.  Some scientists believe that the sun and Jupiter began as\nunequal partners in a binary star system.  (If a double star system had\ndeveloped, it is unlikely life could have arisen in the solar system.)  While\nin a sense a \"failed star,\" Jupiter is almost as large as a planet can be.\nIf it contained more mass, it would not have grown larger, but would have\nshrunk from compression by its own gravity.  If it were 100 times more\nmassive, thermonuclear reactions would ignite, and Jupiter would be a star.\n\n     For a brief period after its formation, Jupiter was much hotter, more\nluminous, and about 10 times larger than it is now, scientists believe.  Soon\nafter accretion (the condensation of a gas and dust cloud into a planet), its\nbrightness dropped from about one percent of the Sun's to about one\nbillionth -- a decline of ten million times.\n\n     In its present state Jupiter emits about twice as much heat as it\nreceives from the Sun.  The loss of this heat -- residual energy left over\nfrom the compressive heat of accretion -- means that Jupiter is cooling and\nlosing energy at a tremendously rapid rate.  Temperatures in Jupiter's core,\nwhich were about 90,000 degrees Fahrenheit in the planet's hot, early\nphase, are now about 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit, 100 times hotter than any\nterrestrial surface, but 500 times cooler than the temperature at the\ncenter of the sun.  Temperatures on Jupiter now range from 54,000 degrees\nFahrenheit at the core to minus 248 degrees Fahrenheit at the top of the\ncloud banks.\n\n     Mainly uniform in composition, Jupiter's structure is determined by\ngradations in temperature and pressure.  Deep in Jupiter's interior there is\nthought to be a small rocky core, comprising about four percent of the\nplanet's mass.  This \"small\" core (about the size of 10 Earths) is surrounded\nby a 25,000-mile-thick layer of liquid metallic hydrogen.  (Metallic\nhydrogen is liquid, but sufficiently compressed to behave as metal.)\nMotions of this liquid \"metal\" are the source of the planet's enormous\nmagnetic field.  This field is created by the same dynamo effect found in\nthe metallic cores of Earth and other planets.\n\n     At the outer limit of the metallic hydrogen layer, pressures equal three\nmillion times that of Earth's atmosphere and the temperature has cooled to\n19,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n     Surrounding the central metallic hydrogen region is an outer shell of\n\"liquid\" molecular hydrogen.  Huge pressures compress Jupiter's gaseous\nhydrogen until, at this level, it behaves like a liquid.  The liquid hydrogen\nlayer extends upward for about 15,000 miles.  Then it gradually becomes\ngaseous.  This transition region between liquid and gas marks, in a sense,\nwhere the solid and liquid planet ends and its atmosphere begins.\n\n     From here, Jupiter's atmosphere extends up for 600 more miles, but only\nin the top 50 miles are found the brilliant bands of clouds for which Jupiter\nis known.  The tops of these bands are colored bright yellow, red and orange\nfrom traces of phosphorous and sulfur.  Five or six of these bands,\ncounterflowing east and west, encircle the planet in each hemisphere.  At\none point near Jupiter's equator, east winds of 220 mph blow right next to\nwest winds of 110 mph.  At boundaries of these bands, rapid changes in\nwind speed and direction create large areas of turbulence and shear.  These\nare the same forces that create tornados here on Earth.  On Jupiter, these\n\"baroclinic instabilities\" are major phenomena, creating chaotic, swirling\nwinds and spiral features such as White Ovals.\n\n     The brightest cloud banks, known as zones, are believed to be higher,\ncooler areas where gases are ascending.  The darker bands, called belts, are\nthought to be warmer, cloudier regions of descent.\n\n     The top cloud layer consists of white cirrus clouds of ammonia crystals,\nat a pressure six-tenths that of Earth's atmosphere at sea level (.6 bar).\nBeneath this layer, at a pressure of about two Earth atmospheres (2 bars)\nand a temperature of near minus 160 degrees Fahrenheit, a reddish-brown\ncloud of ammonium hydrosulfide is predicted.\n\n     At a pressure of about 6 bars, there are believed to be clouds of water\nand ice.  However, recent Earth-based spectroscopic studies suggest that\nthere may be less water on Jupiter than expected.  While scientists\npreviously believed Jupiter and the sun would have similar proportions of\nwater, recent work indicates there may be 100 times less water on Jupiter\nthan if it had a solar mixture of elements.  If this is the case, there may be\nonly a thin layer of water-ice at the 6 bar level.\n\n     However, Jupiter's cloud structure, except for the highest layer of\nammonia crystals, remains uncertain.  The height of the lower clouds is\nstill theoretical -- clouds are predicted to lie at the temperature levels\nwhere their assumed constituents are expected to condense.  The Galileo\nprobe will make the first direct observations of Jupiter's lower atmosphere\nand clouds, providing crucial information.\n\n     The forces driving Jupiter's fast-moving winds are not well understood\nyet.  The classical explanation holds that strong currents are created by\nconvection of heat from Jupiter's hot interior to the cooler polar regions,\nmuch as winds and ocean currents are driven on Earth, from equator to\npoles.  But temperature differences do not fully explain wind velocities\nthat can reach 265 mph.  An alternative theory is that pressure differences,\ndue to changes in the thermodynamic state of hydrogen at high and low\ntemperatures, set up the wind jets.\n\n     Jupiter's rapid rotation rate is thought to have effects on wind velocity\nand to produce some of Jupiter's bizarre circulation patterns, including\nmany spiral features.  These rotational effects are known as\nmanifestations of the Coriolis force.  Coriolis force is what determines the\nspin direction of weather systems.  It basically means that on the surface\nof a sphere (a planet), a parcel of gas farther from the poles has a higher\nrotational velocity around the planet than a parcel closer to the poles.  As\ngases then move north or south, interacting parcels with different\nvelocities produce vortices (whirlpools).  This may account for some of\nJupiter's circular surface features.\n\nJupiter spins faster than any planet in the solar system.  Though 11 times\nEarth's diameter, Jupiter spins more than twice as fast (once in 10 hours),\ngiving gases on the surface extremely high rates of travel -- 22,000 mph at\nthe equator, compared with 1000 mph for air at Earth's equator.  Jupiter's\nrapid spin also causes this gas and liquid planet to flatten markedly at the\npoles and bulge at the equator.\n\n     Visible at the top of Jupiter's atmosphere are eye-catching features\nsuch as the famous Great Red Spot and the exotic White Ovals, Brown\nBarges and White Plumes.  The Great Red Spot, which is 25,000 miles wide\nand large enough to swallow three Earths, is an enormous oval eddy of\nswirling gases.  It is driven by two counter-flowing jet streams, which\npass, one on each side of it, moving in opposite directions, each with speeds\nof 100-200 mph.  The Great Red Spot was first discovered in 1664, by the\nBritish scientist Roger Hook, using Galileo's telescope.  In the three\ncenturies since, the  huge vortex has remained constant in latitude in\nJupiter's southern equatorial belt.  Because of its stable position,\nastronomers once thought it might be a volcano.\n\n     Another past theory compared the Great Red Spot to a gigantic hurricane.\nHowever, the GRS rotates anti-cyclonically while hurricanes are cyclonic\nfeatures (counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, clockwise in the\nsouthern) -- and the dynamics of the Great Red Spot appear unrelated to\nmoisture.\n\n  The Great Red Spot most closely resembles an enormous tornado, a huge\nvortex that sucks in smaller vortices.  The Coriolis effect  created by\nJupiter's fast spin, appears to be the key to the dynamics that drive the\nspot.\n\n     The source of the Great Red Spot's color remains a mystery.  Many\nscientists now believe it to be caused by phosphorus, but its spectral line\ndoes not quite match that of phosphorus.  The GRS may be the largest in a\nwhole array of spiral phenomena with similar dynamics.  About a dozen\nwhite ovals, circulation patterns resembling the GRS, exist in the southern\nlatitudes of Jupiter and appear to be driven by the same forces.  Scientists\ndo not know why these ovals are white.\n\n     Scientists believe the brown barges, which appear like dark patches on\nthe planet, are holes in the upper clouds, through which the reddish-brown\nlower cloud layer may be glimpsed.  The equatorial plumes, or white\nplumes, may be a type of wispy cirrus anvil cloud.\n\n\n\nGALILEO MANAGEMENT\n\n     The Galileo Project is managed for NASA's Office of Space Science and\nApplications by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  This\nresponsibility includes designing, building, testing, operating and tracking\nGalileo.  NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. is responsible\nfor the atmosphere probe, which was built by Hughes Aircraft Company, El\nSegundo, Calif.\n\n     The probe project and science teams will be stationed at Ames during\npre-mission, mission operations, and data reduction periods.  Team\nmembers will be at Jet Propulsion Laboratory for probe entry.\n\n     The Federal Republic of Germany has furnished the orbiter's\nretropropulsion module and is participating in the scientific investigations.\nThe radioisotope thermoelectric generators were designed and built for the\nU.S.  Department of Energy by the General Electric Company.\n\n\n\nSTS-34 INERTIAL UPPER STAGE (IUS-19)\n\n     The Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) will again be used with the Space Shuttle,\nthis time to transport NASA's Galileo spacecraft out of Earth's orbit to\nJupiter, a 2.5-billion-mile journey.\n\nThe IUS has been used previously to place three Tracking and Data Relay\nSatellites in geostationary orbit as well as to inject the Magellan\nspacecraft into its interplanetary trajectory to Venus.  In addition, the IUS\nhas been selected by the agency for the Ulysses solar polar orbit mission.\n\n     After 2 1/2 years of competition, Boeing Aerospace Co., Seattle, was\nselected in August 1976 to begin preliminary design of the IUS.  The IUS\nwas developed and built under contract to the Air Force Systems Command's\nSpace Systems Division.  The Space Systems Division is executive agent for\nall Department of Defense activities pertaining to the Space Shuttle\nsystem.  NASA, through the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.,\npurchases the IUS through the Air Force and manages the integration\nactivities of the upper stage to NASA spacecraft.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n     IUS-19, to be used on mission STS-34, is a two-stage vehicle weighing\napproximately 32,500 lbs.  Each stage has a solid rocket motor (SRM),\npreferred over liquid-fueled engines because of SRM's relative simplicity,\nhigh reliability, low cost and safety.\n\n     The IUS is 17 ft. long and 9.25 ft. in diameter.  It consists of an aft\nskirt, an aft stage SRM generating approximately 42,000 lbs. of thrust, an\ninterstage, a forward-stage SRM generating approximately 18,000 lbs. of\nthrust, and an equipment support section.\n\n\nAIRBORNE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT\n\n     The IUS Airborne Support Equipment (ASE) is the mechanical, avionics\nand structural equipment located in the orbiter.  The ASE supports the IUS\nand the Galileo in the orbiter payload bay and elevates the combination for\nfinal checkout and deployment from the orbiter.\n\n     The IUS ASE consists of the structure, electromechanical mechanisms,\nbatteries, electronics and cabling to support the Galileo/IUS.  These ASE\nsubsystems enable the deployment of the combined vehicle; provide,\ndistribute and/or control electrical power to the IUS and spacecraft;\nprovide plumbing to cool the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG)\naboard Galileo; and serve as communication paths between the IUS and/or\nspacecraft and the orbiter.\n\n\n\nIUS STRUCTURE\n\n     The IUS structure is capable of supporting loads generated internally and\nalso by the cantilevered spacecraft during orbiter operations and the IUS\nfree flight.  It is made of aluminum skin-stringer construction, with\nlongerons and ring frames.\n\n\n\nEQUIPMENT SUPPORT SECTION\n\n     The top of the equipment support section contains the spacecraft\ninterface mounting ring and electrical interface connector segment for\nmating and integrating the spacecraft with the IUS.  Thermal isolation is\nprovided by a multilayer insulation blanket across the interface between\nthe IUS and Galileo.\n\n     The equipment support section also contains the avionics which provide\nguidance, navigation, control, telemetry, command and data management,\nreaction control and electrical power.  All mission-critical components of\nthe avionics system, along with thrust vector actuators, reaction control\nthrusters, motor igniter and pyrotechnic stage separation equipment are\nredundant to assure reliability of better than 98 percent.\n\n\nIUS AVIONICS SUBSYSTEMS\n\n     The avionics subsystems consist of the telemetry, tracking and\ncommand subsystems; guidance and navigation subsystem; data\nmanagement; thrust vector control; and electrical power subsystems.\nThese subsystems include all the electronic and electrical hardware used to\nperform all computations, signal conditioning, data processing and\nformatting associated with navigation, guidance, control, data and\nredundancy management.  The IUS avionics subsystems also provide the\nequipment for communications between the orbiter and ground stations as\nwell as electrical power distribution.\n\n     Attitude control in response to guidance commands is provided by thrust\nvectoring during powered flight and by reaction control thrusters while\ncoasting.  Attitude is compared with guidance commands to generate error\nsignals.  During solid motor firing, these commands gimble the IUS's\nmovable nozzle to provide the desired pitch and yaw control.  The IUS's roll\naxis thrusters maintain roll control.  While coasting, the error signals are\nprocessed in the computer to generate thruster commands to maintain the\nvehicle's altitude or to maneuver the vehicle.\n\n     The IUS electrical power subsystem consists of avionics batteries, IUS\npower distribution units, a power transfer unit, utility batteries, a\npyrotechnic switching unit, an IUS wiring harness and umbilical and staging\nconnectors.  The IUS avionics system provides 5-volt electrical power to\nthe Galileo/IUS interface connector for use by the spacecraft telemetry\nsystem.\n\n\n\nIUS SOLID ROCKET MOTORS\n\n     The IUS two-stage vehicle uses a large solid rocket motor and a small\nsolid rocket motor.  These motors employ movable nozzles for thrust vector\ncontrol.  The nozzles provide up to 4 degrees of steering on the large motor\nand 7 degrees on the small motor.  The large motor is the longest-thrusting\nduration SRM ever developed for space, with the capability to thrust as long\nas 150 seconds.  Mission requirements and constraints (such as weight) can\nbe met by tailoring the amount of propellant carried.  The IUS-19\nfirst-stage motor will carry 21,488 lb. of propellant; the second stage\n6,067 lb.\n\n\nREACTION CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe reaction control system controls the Galileo/IUS spacecraft attitude\nduring coasting, roll control during SRM thrustings, velocity impulses for\naccurate orbit injection and the final collision-avoidance maneuver after\nseparation from the Galileo spacecraft.\n\nAs a minimum, the IUS includes one reaction control fuel tank with a\ncapacity of 120 lb. of hydrazine.  Production options are available to add a\nsecond or third tank.  However, IUS-19 will require only one tank.\n\n\n\nIUS TO SPACECRAFT INTERFACES\n\nGalileo is physically attached to the IUS at eight attachment points,\nproviding substantial load-carrying capability while minimizing the\ntransfer of heat across the connecting points.   Power, command and data\ntransmission between the two are provided by several IUS interface\nconnectors.   In addition, the IUS provides a multilayer insulation blanket of\naluminized Kapton with polyester net spacers across the Galileo/IUS\ninterface, along with an aluminized Beta cloth outer layer.  All IUS thermal\nblankets are vented toward and into the IUS cavity, which in turn is vented\nto the orbiter payload bay.  There is no gas flow between the spacecraft and\nthe IUS.  The thermal blankets are grounded to the IUS structure to prevent\nelectrostatic charge buildup.\n\n\nFLIGHT SEQUENCE\n\nAfter the orbiter payload bay doors are opened in orbit, the orbiter will\nmaintain a preselected attitude to keep the payload within thermal\nrequirements and constraints.\n\nOn-orbit predeployment checkout begins, followed by an IUS command link\ncheck and spacecraft communications command check.  Orbiter trim\nmaneuvers are normally performed at this time.\n\n     Forward payload restraints will be released and the aft frame of the\nairborne-support equipment will tilt the Galileo/IUS to 29 degrees.  This\nwill extend the payload into space just outside the orbiter payload bay,\nallowing direct communication with Earth during systems checkout.  The\norbiter then will be maneuvered to the deployment attitude.  If a problem\nhas developed within the spacecraft or IUS, the IUS and its payload can be\nrestowed.\n\n     Prior to deployment, the spacecraft electrical power source will be\nswitched from orbiter power to IUS internal power by the orbiter flight\ncrew.  After verifying that the spacecraft is on IUS internal power and that\nall Galileo/IUS predeployment operations have been successfully completed,\na GO/NO-GO decision for deployment will be sent to the crew from ground\nsupport.\n\n     When the orbiter flight crew is given a \"Go\" decision, they will activate\nthe ordnance that separates the spacecraft's umbilical cables.  The crew\nthen will command the electromechanical tilt actuator to raise the tilt\ntable to a 58-degree deployment position.  The orbiter's RCS thrusters will\nbe inhibited and an ordnance-separation device initiated to physically\nseparate the IUS/spacecraft combination from the tilt table.\n\n     Six hours, 20 minutes into the mission, compressed springs provide the\nforce to jettison the IUS/Galileo from the orbiter payload bay at\napproximately 6 inches per second.  The deployment is normally performed\nin the shadow of the orbiter or in Earth eclipse.\n\n     The tilt table then will be lowered to minus 6 degrees after IUS and its\nspacecraft are deployed.  A small orbiter maneuver is made to back away\nfrom IUS/Galileo.  Approximately 15 minutes after deployment, the\norbiter's OMS engines will be ignited to move the orbiter away from its\nreleased payload.\n\n     After deployment, the IUS/Galileo is controlled by the IUS onboard\ncomputers.  Approximately 10 minutes after IUS/Galileo deployment from\nthe orbiter, the IUS onboard computer will send out signals used by the IUS\nand/or Galileo to begin mission sequence events.  This signal will also\nenable the IUS reaction control system.  All subsequent operations will be\nsequenced by the IUS computer, from transfer orbit injection through\nspacecraft separation and IUS deactivation.\n\n     After the RCS has been activated, the IUS will maneuver to the required\nthermal attitude and perform any required spacecraft thermal control\nmaneuvers.\n\n     At approximately 45 minutes after deployment from the orbiter, the\nordnance inhibits for the first SRM will be removed.  The belly of the\norbiter already will have been oriented towards the IUS/Galileo to protect\norbiter windows from the IUS's plume.  The IUS will recompute the first\nignition time and maneuvers necessary to attain the proper attitude for the\nfirst thrusting period.  When the proper transfer orbit opportunity is\nreached, the IUS computer will send the signal to ignite the first stage\nmotor 60 minutes after deployment.  After firing approximately 150\nseconds, the IUS first stage will have expended its propellant and will be\nseparated from the IUS second stage.\n\n     Approximately 140 seconds after first-stage burnout, the second- stage\nmotor will be ignited, thrusting about 108 seconds.   The IUS second stage\nthen will separate and perform a final collision/contamination avoidance\nmaneuver before deactivating.\n\n\nSHUTTLE SOLAR BACKSCATTER ULTRAVIOLET INSTRUMENT\n\n     The Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) instrument was\ndeveloped by NASA to calibrate similar ozone measuring space-based\ninstruments on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's\nTIROS satellites (NOAA-9 and -11).\n\n     The SSBUV will help scientists solve the problem of data reliability\ncaused by calibration drift of solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV)\ninstruments on orbiting spacecraft.  The SSBUV uses the Space Shuttle's\norbital flight path to assess instrument performance by directly comparing\ndata from identical instruments aboard the TIROS spacecraft, as the\nShuttle and the satellite pass over the same Earth location within a 1-hour\nwindow.  These orbital coincidences can occur 17 times per day.\n\n     The SBUV measures the amount and height distribution of ozone in the\nupper atmosphere.  It does this by measuring incident solar ultraviolet\nradiation and ultraviolet radiation backscattered from the Earth's\natmosphere.  The SBUV measures these parameters in 12 discrete\nwavelength channels in the ultraviolet.  Because ozone absorbs in the\nultraviolet, an ozone measurement can be derived from the ratio of\nbackscatter radiation at different wavelengths, providing an index of the\nvertical distribution of ozone in the atmosphere.\n\n     Global concern over the depletion of the ozone layer has sparked\nincreased emphasis on developing and improving ozone measurement\nmethods and instruments.  Accurate, reliable measurements from space are\ncritical to the detection of ozone trends and for assessing the potential\neffects and development of corrective measures.\n\n     The SSBUV missions are so important to the support of Earth science\nthat six additional missions have been added to the Shuttle manifest for\ncalibrating ozone instruments on future TIROS satellites.  In addition, the\ndates of the four previously manifested SSBUV flights have been\naccelerated.\n\n     The SSBUV instrument and its dedicated electronics, power, data and\ncommand systems are mounted in the Shuttle's payload bay in two Get Away\nSpecial canisters, an instrument canister and a support canister.  Together,\nthey weigh approximately 1200 lb.   The instrument canister holds the\nSSBUV, its specially designed aspect sensors and in-flight calibration\nsystem.  A motorized door assembly opens the canister to allow the SSBUV\nto view the sun and Earth and closes during the in-flight calibration\nsequence.\n\n     The support canister contains the power system, data storage and\ncommand decoders.  The dedicated power system can operate the SSBUV for\na total of approximately 40 hours.\n\n     The SSBUV is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,\nMd.  Ernest Hilsenrath is the principal investigator.\n\n\n\nGROWTH HORMONE CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN PLANTS\n\n     The Growth Hormone Concentration and Distribution in Plants (GHCD)\nexperiment is designed to determine the effects of microgravity on the\nconcentration, turnover properties, and behavior of the plant growth\nhormone, Auxin, in corn shoot tissue (Zea Mays).\n\n     Mounted in foam blocks inside two standard middeck lockers, the\nequipment consists of four plant cannisters, two gaseous nitrogen freezers\nand two temperature recorders.  Equipment for the experiment, excluding\nthe lockers, weighs 97.5 pounds.\n\n     A total of 228 specimens (Zea Mays seeds) are \"planted\" in special\nfilter, paper-Teflon tube holders no more than 56 hours prior to flight.  The\nseeds remain in total darkness throughout the mission.\n\n     The GHCD experiment equipment and specimens will be prepared in a\nPayload Processing Facility at KSC and placed in the middeck lockers.  The\nGHCD lockers will be installed in the orbiter middeck within the last 14\nhours before launch.\n\n     No sooner than 72 hours after launch, mission specialist Ellen Baker will\nplace two of the plant cannisters into the gaseous nitrogen freezers to\narrest the plant growth and preserve the specimens.  The payload will be\nrestowed in the lockers for the remainder of the mission.\n\n     After landing, the payload must be removed from the orbiter within 2\nhours and will be returned to customer representatives at the landing site.\nThe specimens will be examined post flight for microgravity effects.\n\n      The GHCD experiment is sponsored by NASA Headquarters, the Johnson\nSpace Center and Michigan State University.\n\n\nPOLYMER MORPHOLOGY\n\n     The Polymer Morphology (PM) experiment is a 3M-developed organic\nmaterials processing experiment designed to explore the effects of\nmicrogravity on polymeric materials as they are processed in space.\n\n     Since melt processing is one of the more industrially significant\nmethods for making products from polymers, it has been chosen for study in\nthe PM experiment.  Key aspects of melt processing include polymerization,\ncrystallization and phase separation.  Each aspect will be examined in the\nexperiment.  The polymeric systems for the first flight of PM include\npolyethelyne, nylon-6 and polymer blends.\n\n     The apparatus for the experiment includes a Fournier transform infrared\n(FTIR) spectrometer, an automatic sample manipulating system and a\nprocess control and data acquisition computer known as the Generic\nElectronics Module (GEM).  The experiment is contained in two separate,\nhermetically sealed containers that are mounted in the middeck of the\norbiter.  Each container includes an integral heat exchanger that transfers\nheat from the interior of the containers to the orbiter's environment.  All\nsample materials are kept in triple containers for the safety of the\nastronauts.\n\n     The PM experiment weighs approximately 200 lb., occupies three\nstandard middeck locker spaces (6 cubic ft., total) in the orbiter and\nrequires 240 watts to operate.\n\n     Mission specialists Franklin R. Chang-Diaz and Shannon W. Lucid are\nresponsible for the operation of the PM experiment on orbit.  Their interface\nwith the PM experiment is through a small, NASA-supplied laptop computer\nthat is used as an input and output device for the main PM computer.  This\ninterface has been programmed by 3M engineers to manage and display the\nlarge quantity of data that is available to the crew.  The astronauts will\nhave an active role in the operation of the experiment.\n\n     In the PM experiment, infrared spectra (400 to 5000 cm-1) will be\nacquired from the FTIR by the GEM computer once every 3.2 seconds as the\nmaterials are processed on orbit.  During the 100 hours of processing time,\napproximately 2 gigabytes of data will be collected.  Post flight, 3M\nscientists will process the data to reveal the effects of microgravity on\nthe samples processed in space.\n\n     The PM experiment is unique among material processing experiments in\nthat measurements characterizing the effects of microgravity will be made\nin real time, as the materials are processed in space.\n\n     In most materials processing space experiments, the materials have\nbeen processed in space with little or no measurements made during\non-orbit processing and the effects of microgravity determined post facto.\n\n     The samples of polymeric materials being studied in the PM experiment\nare thin films (25 microns or less) approximately 25 mm in diameter.  The\nsamples are mounted between two infrared transparent windows in a\nspecially designed infrared cell that provides the capability of  thermally\nprocessing the samples to 200 degrees Celsius with a high degree of\nthermal control.  The samples are mounted on a carousel that allows them\nto be positioned, one at a time, in the infrared beam where spectra may be\nacquired.  The GEM provides all carousel and sample cell control.  The first\nflight of PM will contain 17 samples.\n\n     The PM experiment is being conducted by 3M's Space Research and\nApplications Laboratory.  Dr. Earl L. Cook is 3M's Payload Representative and\nMission Coordinator.  Dr. Debra L. Wilfong is  PM's Science Coordinator, and\nJames E. Steffen is the Hardware Coordinator.\n\n     The PM experiment, a commercial development payload, is sponsored by\nNASA's Office of Commercial Programs.  The PM experiment will be 3M's\nfifth space experiment and the first under the company's 10-year Joint\nEndeavor Agreement with NASA for 62 flight experiment opportunities.\nPrevious 3M space experiments have studied organic crystal growth from\nsolution (DMOS/1 on mission STS 51-A and DMOS/2 on STS 61-B) and\norganic thin film growth by physical vapor treatment (PVTOS/1 on STS 51-I\nand PVTOS/2 on mission STS-26).\n\n\n\n\nSTUDENT EXPERIMENT\n\nZero Gravity Growth of Ice Crystals From Supercooled Water With Relation\nTo Temperature (SE82-15)\n\n     This experiment, proposed by Tracy L. Peters, formerly of Ygnacio High\nSchool, Concord, Calif., will observe the geometric ice crystal shapes\nformed at supercooled temperatures, below 0 degrees Celsius, without the\ninfluence of gravity.\n\n     Liquid water has been discovered at temperatures far below water's\nfreezing point.  This phonomenon occurs because liquid water does not have\na nucleus, or core, around which to form the crystal.  When the ice freezes\nat supercold temperatures, the ice takes on many geometric shapes based\non the hexagon.  The shape of the crystal primarily depends on the\nsupercooled temperature and saturation of water vapor.  The shapes of\ncrystals vary from simple plates to complex prismatic crystals.\n\n     Many scientists have tried to determine the relation between\ntemperature and geometry, but gravity has deformed crystals, caused\nconvection currents in temperature-controlled apparatus, and caused faults\nin the crystalline structure.  These all affect crystal growth by either rapid\nfluctuations of temperature or gravitational influence of the crystal\ngeometry.\n\nThe results of this experiment could aid in the design of radiator cooling\nand cryogenic systems and in the understanding of high-altitude\nmeteorology and planetary ring structure theories.\n\nPeters is now studying physics at the University of California at Berkeley.\nHis teacher advisor is James R. Cobb, Ygnacio High School; his sponsor is\nBoeing Aerospace Corp., Seattle.\n\nPeters also was honored as the first four-time NASA award winner at the\nInternational Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), which recognizes\nstudent's creative scientific endeavors in aerospace research.  At the 1982\nISEF, Peters was one of two recipients of the Glen T. Seaborg Nobel Prize\nVisit Award, an all-expense-paid visit to Stockholm to attend the Nobel\nPrize ceremonies, for his project \"Penetration and Diffusion of Supersonic\nFluid.\"</font> <br /><br /><font face=\"courier\"><b>Text found in Volume_300_Galileo_Space_Disk.dsk/STS.34.PART.4.txt:</b><br /><br />\nMESOSCALE LIGHTNING EXPERIMENT\n------------------------------\n\n     The Space Shuttle will again carry the Mesoscale Lightning Experiment\n(MLE), designed to obtain nighttime images of lightning in order to better\nunderstand the global distribution of lightning, the interrelationships\nbetween lightning events in nearby storms, and relationships between\nlightning, convective storms and precipitation.\n\n     A better understanding of the relationships between lightning and\nthunderstorm characteristics can lead to the development of applications in\nsevere storm warning and forecasting, and early warning systems for\nlightning threats to life and property.\n\n     In recent years, NASA has used both Space Shuttle missions and\nhigh-altitude U-2 aircraft to observe lightning from above convective\nstorms.  The objectives of these observations have been to determine some\nof the baseline design requirements for a satellite-borne optical lightning\nmapper sensor; study the overall optical and electrical characteristics of\nlightning as viewed from above the cloudtop; and investigate the\nrelationship between storm electrical development and the structure,\ndynamics and evolution of thunderstorms and thunderstorm systems.\n\n     The MLE began as an experiment to demonstrate that meaningful,\nqualitative observations of lightning could be made from the Shuttle.\nHaving accomplished this, the experiment is now focusing on quantitative\nmeasurements of lightning characteristics and observation simulations for\nfuture space-based lightning sensors.\n\n     Data from the MLE will provide information for the development of\nobservation simulations for an upcoming polar platform and Space Station\ninstrument, the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS).  The lightning experiment\nalso will be helpful for designing procedures for using the Lightning Mapper\nSensor (LMS), planned for several geostationary platforms.\n\n      In this experiment, Atlantis'  payload bay camera will be pointed\ndirectly below the orbiter to observe nighttime lightning in large, or\nmesoscale, storm systems to gather global estimates of lightning as\nobserved from Shuttle altitudes.  Scientists on the ground will analyze the\nimagery for the frequency of lightning flashes in active storm clouds\nwithin the camera's field of view, the length of lightning discharges, and\ncloud brightness when illuminated by the lightning discharge within the\ncloud.\n\n     If time permits during missions, astronauts also will use a handheld\n35mm camera to photograph lightning activity in storm systems not\ndirectly below the Shuttle's orbital track.\n\n     Data from the MLE will be associated with ongoing observations of\nlightning made at several locations on the ground, including observations\nmade at facilities at the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.;\nKennedy Space Center, Fla.; and the NOAA Severe Storms Laboratory,\nNorman, Okla.  Other ground-based lightning detection systems in Australia,\nSouth America and Africa will be intergrated when possible.\n\nThe MLE is managed by the Marshall Space Flight Center.  Otha H. Vaughan\nJr., is coordinating the experiment.  Dr. Hugh Christian is the project\nscientist, and Dr. James Arnold is the project manager.\n\n\n\nIMAX\n----\n\n     The IMAX project is a collaboration between NASA and the Smithsonian\nInstitution's National Air and Space Museum to document significant space\nactivities using the IMAX film medium.  This system, developed by the IMAX\nSystems Corp., Toronto, Canada, uses specially designed 70mm film\ncameras and projectors to record and display very high definition\nlarge-screen color motion pictures.\n\n     IMAX cameras previously have flown on Space Shuttle missions 41-C,\n41-D and 41-G to document crew operations in the payload bay and the\norbiter's middeck and flight deck along with spectacular views of space and\nEarth.\n\n     Film from those missions form the basis for the IMAX production, \"The\nDream is Alive.\"  On STS 61-B, an IMAX camera mounted in the payload bay\nrecorded extravehicular activities in the EAS/ACCESS space construction\ndemonstrations.\n\n     The IMAX camera, most recently carried aboard STS-29, will be used on\nthis mission to cover the deployment of the Galileo spacecraft and to\ngather material on the use of observations of the Earth from space for\nfuture IMAX films.\n\n\n\nAIR FORCE MAUI OPTICAL SITE CALIBRATION TEST\n--------------------------------------------\n\n     The Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) tests allow ground-based\nelectro-optical sensors located on Mt. Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii, to collect\nimagery and signature data of the orbiter during cooperative overflights.\nScientific observations made of the orbiter while performing Reaction\nControl System thruster firings, water dumps or payload bay light\nactivation are used to support the calibration of the AMOS sensors and the\nvalidation of spacecraft contamination models.  AMOS tests have no\npayload-unique flight hardware and only require that the orbiter be in\npredefined attitude operations and lighting conditions.\n\n     The AMOS facility was developed by Air Force Systems Command (AFSC)\nthrough its Rome Air Development Center, Griffiss Air Force Base, N.Y., and\nis administered and operated by the AVCO Everett Research Laboratory,\nMaui.  The principal investigator for the AMOS tests on the Space Shuttle is\nfrom AFSC's Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, Hanscom Air Force Base,\nMass.  A co-principal investigator is from AVCO.\n\n     Flight planning and mission support activities for the AMOS test\nopportunities are provided by a detachment of AFSC's Space Systems\nDivision at Johnson Space Center, Houston.  Flight operations are conducted\nat JSC Mission Control Center in coordination with the AMOS facilities\nlocated in Hawaii.\n\n\n\nSENSOR TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENT\n----------------------------\n\n     The Sensor Technology Experiment (STEX) is a radiation detection\nexperiment designed to measure the natural radiation background.  The STEX\nis a self-contained experiment with its own power, sensor, computer\ncontrol and data storage.  A calibration pack, composed of a small number\nof passive threshold reaction monitors, is attached to the outside of the\nSTEX package.\n\n     Sponsored by the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the STEX\npackage weighs approximately 50 pounds and is stowed in a standard\nmiddeck locker throughout the flight.\n\n\n\nPAYLOAD AND VEHICLE WEIGHTS\n---------------------------\n\n     Vehicle/Payload                                  Weight (Pounds)\n\n\n        Orbiter (Atlantis) Empty        172,018\n\n        Galileo/IUS (payload bay)       43,980\n\n        Galileo support hardware  (middeck)     59\n\n        SSBUV (payload bay)     637\n\n        SSBUV support   578\n\n        DSO     49\n\n        DTO     170\n\n        GHCD    130\n\n        IMAX    269\n\n        MLE     15\n\n        PM      219\n\n        SSIP    70\n\n        STEX    52\n\n        Orbiter and Cargo at SRB Ignition       264,775\n\n        Total Vehicle at SRB Ignition   4,523,810\n\n        Orbiter Landing Weight  195,283\n\n\n\nSPACEFLIGHT TRACKING AND DATA NETWORK\n-------------------------------------\n\n     Primary communications for most activities on STS-34 will be\nconducted through the orbiting Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System\n(TDRSS), a constellation of three communications satellites in\ngeosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth.  In addition, three NASA\nSpaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN) ground stations and the NASA\nCommunications Network (NASCOM), both managed by Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, Greenbelt, Md., will play key roles in the mission.\n\n     Three stations -- Merritt Island and Ponce de Leon, Florida and the\nBermuda -- serve as the primary communications during the launch and\nascent phases of the mission.  For the first 80 seconds, all voice, telemetry\nand other communications from the Space Shuttle are relayed to the\nmission managers at Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers by way of the\nMerritt Island facility.\n\n     At 80 seconds, the communications are picked up from the Shuttle and\nrelayed to the two NASA centers from the Ponce de Leon facility, 30 miles\nnorth of the launch pad.  This facility provides the communications between\nthe Shuttle and the centers for 70 seconds, or until 150 seconds into the\nmission.  This is during a critical period when exhaust from the solid rocket\nmotors \"blocks out\" the Merritt Island antennas.\n\n     The Merritt Island facility resumes communications to and from the\nShuttle after those 70 seconds and maintains them until 6 minutes, 30\nseconds after launch when communications are \"switched over\" to Bermuda.\nBermuda then provides the communications until 11 minutes after liftoff\nwhen the TDRS-East satellite acquires the Shuttle.  TDRS-West acquires\nthe orbiter at launch plus 50 minutes.\n\n     The TDRS-East and -West satellites will provide communications with\nthe Shuttle during 85 percent or better of each orbit.  The TDRS-West\nsatellite will handle communications with the Shuttle during its descent\nand landing phases.\n\n\n\nCREW BIOGRAPHIES\n----------------\n\n     Donald E.
