The site off-loaded an average of three cars per minute. The electronics are called e-waste.\n\nAbout 700 cars dropped off electronics during the event organized by the City of Milwaukee DPW was held on April 26, 2008\n\nMore than two thirds of the collection involved computers and related equipment.\n\nThe DPW collected  643 computer monitors weighing over ten tons; 338 televisions weighing over 5 tons, over 7 tons of personal computers and nearly 5 tons of computer printers. Eight percent of the collection, nearly 5,000 pounds, involved miscellaneous e-waste like cell phones.\n-------\nEquipment type\tPounds\tPercent by Weight \nMonitors\t\t21,188\t\t33%\t(643 computer monitors recycled)\nPCs\t\t\t15,098\t\t24% \nTVs\t\t\t13,185\t\t21%\t(338 televisions recycled)\nPrinters\t\t9,148\t\t14% \nMiscellaneous\t4,878\t\t 8% \nTOTAL\t\t63,497\t\t100%\n-------\nThe challenge was important because scrap electronics are the fastest growing segment of municipal solid waste stream.\n\nE-waste may contain hazardous materials including lead, mercury and heavy metals that can pose a risk to human and environmental health. The EPA awarded $500,000 in grants to numerous cities participating in the challenge including the city of Milwaukee.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said the \"recycling televisions and computers reduces the risks of toxins contained in these products being released into our air and water.\"\n\nEvent partners included the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, city of Milwaukee Department of Public Works (DPW), Keep Greater Milwaukee Beautiful, the Italian Community Center, Midwest Computer Recyclers  and WISN-TV.\n\nAbout 3.5 tons of pharmaceuticals were turned during the Milwaukee area's Medicine Collection Day sponsored by the MMSD.\n\nThe collection name was a \"prescription for clean water and safe kids.\"\n-------\n                                       Non-Controlled   Controlled\n                     Participants      Substances       Substances\n                                                                               Milwaukee County        1,080            4,487 lbs      36,831 (Pills, Patches & Bottles)\nOzaukee County            365            1,022 lbs       3 (30 gallon drums)\n\nRacine County             523              761 lbs              50 lbs\n\nWashington County         380              743 lbs              83 lbs\n\nTotals:\t\t      2,348             7,013 lbs                \n-------\nVeolia Environmental Services incinerates non-controlled substances at a federally licensed facility.\n\nMedicine collection partners:\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Milwaukee Police, Milwaukee Brewers, City of Milwaukee, Aurora Pharmacy, Columbia St. Mary's, City of Racine, Racine Police Department, Burlington Police Department, Western Racine County Health Department, Caledonia/Mt.

Brad Brown, campus pastor at Marquette University Lutheran Campus Ministry in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThe Milwaukee events were among about 100 projects involving hundreds of communities across eight states around the Great Lakes basin that participated in the EPA Earth Day 2008 challenge.\n\nThe goal was the collecting and recycling of one million pounds of electronics plus the collection and proper disposal of one million pills.\n\nThe EHI assisted challenge organizers by offering interfaith liaisons to volunteer and encourage members of local churches and temples to participate in the Earth Day related events in their area.\n\nThis video was made possible by a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 office and the EPA Great Lakes national Program Office in Chicago to the EHI in Marquette MI.\n\nThe EHI involves American Indian tribes and \"a coalition of churches synagogues and other faith traditions joining together to heal protect and defend the environment\" said founder Rev Jon Magnuson of Marquette.\n\n\n--\nSupers:\n\nBharat Mathur\nEPA deputy regional administrator \nEPA Region 5 Office in Chicago\n\nTom Barrett\nMilwaukee Mayor\n\nRick Meyers\nDirector/City of Milwaukee Department of Public Works (DPW)\n\nMilwaukee Medicine Collection Photos by Susan Boehme\n\n---\nSponsor/Contact:\nMilwaukee Metro Sewerage District\n260 West Seeboth St.\nMilwaukee, WI 53204\n\nSteve Jacquart, Milwaukee Metro Sewerage District\n414-225-2138 (wk)\n---\nMilwaukee Metro Sewerage District:\nhttp://www.mmsd.com\n---\nMilorganite - How do we make this stuff?\nhttp://www.mmsd.com/news/detail.cfm?id=114\n---\nMilwaukee pdf flyer - scroll down pdf to bottom to see mini-version:\nhttp://www.mmsd.com/images/programs/MedicineCollection_041908.pdf\n---\nFor more information on the collection contact:\nCity of Milwaukee Dept of Public Works Rick Meyers\n414-286-2334\n---\nMilwaukee Dept.
